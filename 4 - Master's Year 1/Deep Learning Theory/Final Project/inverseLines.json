[{"prompt": "Who would say this? They're advancing down our weak right flank. For a bunch of soulless machines, they seem to know a thing or two. But we'll see. Yeah. That's a good idea. Any more time spent hanging around here and we're done for. Or we can stay and fight? We may die if we take a stand here. But staying gives us the chance to change our destinies. We have the Monado. With this, the future is ours for the taking! Getting short sighted in your old age, Dickson? I'm fine. Don't worry, I'm still in control. As long as you think you've still got the strength in you, old man. Well I say you're coming with us! What would we do without those? Acknowledged! They'll have to be if they want to beat us. Now, let's even the odds a bit! Dickson, Mumkhar. Let's do this! What does it look like? I'm still good to go! Mumkhar?! What are you doing?! That way is- Dickson, take care of the survivors. Vile Mechon! If you think the Homs, the people of Bionis, are just waiting here for you to pick us off... You are sorely mistaken!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A Mechon M71! I bet I can use its optical system to align one of the Anti-Air Batteries. No good. It's broken. The joint section. It's buckled. It's completely useless. An M69! Its armour would be perfect for making a shield. If I can just get it off, I should be able to...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn! It's not a Mechon! It's just a Krabble! It was using the Mechon armour as a shell!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'll lure it away and Topple it! When it's down, use your Arts to finish it off!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thanks, Reyn. That was a close one.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Man, what were you doing wandering off by yourself? Stay where I can keep an eye on you. It's pretty dangerous outside of the colony. There are all kinds of monsters.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. But thanks to you, we got its shell. Everyone in the colony's gonna be really happy.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm more worried about you than the shell. Ah...whatever. Knowing what you're like, at least you'll make a decent weapon out of it. This Scrap Driver's excellent.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I just learned by watching Dickson make weapons.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? 'Course, Dunban's weapon still beats them all.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Monado... I hope I can figure out the secret of its power one day.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You will, Shulk. Anyway, we'd better get back to the colony. If I'm late for drills again, old Square-tache is gonna kill me.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Square-tache? Oh, the Defence Force Colonel. He's pretty scary.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Tell me about it...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry, I didn't mean for you to come all the way out here during your break.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't worry about it. Let's get back. Here we are. I'd better stop in at HQ. You off to the Weapon Development Lab?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, when I've sold any parts I can't use.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? All right. See you later.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Uh-oh! The colonel's gonna explode. Same old colonel. At this rate, the men will all be dead before they see any action. Dickson! When did you get back to Colony 9? Your research notes really helped. Well, anyone can activate it. The problem is controlling it. Yes. If anyone other than Dunban were able to control the Monado, we could surpass any military force in the world. It's still only conjecture, but it's starting to look like the Monado might be something far more significant than just a weapon for defeating Mechon. It's the symbol that appears in the centre when it's activated. What I know is, the central piece is made from multilayered glass. The symbol appears on the top layer. And each layer is constructed differently. Which means... If we could just unlock the Monado's power...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban! Dunban!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't look like that. I haven't gone yet. Shulk... It was the Monado. It was...controlling me... Even so... It saved us...saved our future... Next...it will be up to you...", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban... OK then. I'll see you later.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban, are you awake yet?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is it time to eat already? You didn't have to bring it yourself. You could have just called me.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't be silly! Do you want me to feed you?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't treat me like an invalid. I'm better than I was a year ago.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Much better. I really thought I lost you back then...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. But now I'm almost well enough to handle the Monado again.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban, don't say that! The Mechon have gone now! Why would you say that?!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I just mean I'm prepared. Sorry.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. More importantly, eat up before it gets cold. I made something really special today.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't feel like you need to stay here then, Fiora. Go and make your next delivery. Well, I'm sure you'd like Shulk to try some while it's still hot?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's OK. Shulk has no sense of taste. He'll say it's delicious even if it's stone cold.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? In which case today he would actually mean it.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Maybe.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm fine, Fiora. Off you go.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. Dunban... Thanks.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm not finished yet. I have to be prepared to use the Monado again.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson! I just thought I'd take Shulk some food. I'm on my way to the lab. Really? Outlook Park! OK. Thanks, Dickson.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Monado... It's the only sword that's effective against the Mechon armour. They say that before time began, it was wielded by the Bionis. The same Bionis that we all live on. It must have a secret. That's how Dunban was able to destroy so many Mechon. And why he lost the use of his right arm. If I can just unlock the secret of its power...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! This is great! It tastes so good!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Really?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's amazing!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh, Shulk, you say that every day.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not quite. It's always delicious. But today it's amazing.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Really?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thank goodness! I used some special herbs and spices today. So if you said it was just the same as usual, I'd know for sure you had no sense of taste!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh, nothing. The breeze feels so good.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. I'd forgotten what it feels like. I never thought it could be so quiet here.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're spending too much time with Reyn. You're getting used to all the noise he makes.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, maybe.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's so peaceful. You know, Shulk, I hope every day can be like this, always.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The debris siren.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Strange. There hasn't been much falling lately.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There might be more on the way. The Anti-Air Batteries can't protect us out here. Let's get back to the lab.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. Reyn?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn! What are you doing?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk?! No, I'm just...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Goodness.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! Are you OK?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm fine.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's broken.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do you mean it's broken?! Don't you care about me?! I could have died!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're not hurt, are you? The Monado can't cut people. More importantly... What were you thinking, Reyn?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry. I came to ask a favour but you weren't here. And I saw the Monado and-", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I know I'm here a lot. But even I need fresh air sometimes. Is your body still feeling numb? We have to be very careful with the Monado. It's not a toy.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I know, man. I just wanted to touch it. I didn't know it would do that. Sorry. But is it true? The Monado really can't cut people?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The pattern in that circle... Or maybe it's a symbol? I think it shows which power the Monado has at the moment.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You think it's a symbol?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well, if I can find a way to increase the number of symbols, I should...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm sure that's all very clever. But! Why were you more worried about a machine than me, Shulk?!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well, I just... I just explained why.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's not the point!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry! So of course I want to get my revenge! No!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Shulk!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What on Bionis happened there?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn, Fiora...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are you OK? Does it hurt?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. Reyn, when you held the Monado, did you see anything?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You know... Like, a blue blade made of light came out. Same as just now.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't mean that... A feeling like time had stopped. And then...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Time had stopped?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So...was it only me who saw that?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That sounds strange. Is it another Monado thing?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who knows? Anyway, no matter how good a sword it is, if that's what happens when you hold it... Looks like Dunban really is the only one who can use it.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I won't let my brother use it ever again! Not after what it did to him.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh, sorry... I didn't mean it like that...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Anyway, the point is, I'm fine. To be honest, this has happened a few times before. I've been researching the Monado for a long time.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Don't act as if this is nothing!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look, don't worry about it. Anyway, Reyn, what did you want to ask me about?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ah, yeah. Old Square-tache has gone and put me on punishment duty. Fancy tagging along?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Punishment? The colonel was pretty angry today. Did he hit you?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well, whether he hit me is neither here nor there, really... Although actually he did end up hitting me. And that ain't all. He made me do a thousand squats and sit-ups.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Whoa, nasty.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. And now I have to go all the way to the Mag Mell Ruins and back.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So you have to go and collect the Ether Cylinders?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's the one! They're used to power the mobile artillery. It looks like the damage's been repaired. But it can't move without the ether energy. And it seems like the fuelling station's all out of stock.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is the mobile artillery that big machine that crashed in the Residential District?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, probably.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You know your way around there, right?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. OK, I'll go with you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah! Knew you would!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hold on. The Mag Mell Ruins are in Tephra Cave, right? I heard that there's a Mell Lizard nest there. I couldn't take it if anything happened to Shulk. He's delicate - not like you, Reyn.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What are you on about?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'll be fine. I can take care of myself.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK, I got it. I'll make you a promise. Shulk won't even get a scratch.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A promise doesn't mean much coming from you!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? She don't trust me at all.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nah, she doesn't mean it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You forgot something. You will be needing the transport cases, right?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm coming along as well. I'd feel better going with you boys than sitting at home worrying about you. So, let's get moving!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I knew she didn't trust me.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Looks like it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are these the Mag Mell Ruins?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Haven't you been here before?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nope.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Defence Force often uses it for training. But I come here to do research. It's not really a place that people go.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not surprising. There are monsters around here that use Mechon parts as armour.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Was this built by the Mechon?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't think so. There's a path for people to get in. It might have been a vehicle of some kind.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Like the Defence Force hover transports?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A vehicle? But it's so big...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's amazing technology. I wonder what kind of people made it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I ain't got a clue.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Let's keep moving. The Ether Cylinders are up ahead.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right! Right here! Thanks for the help, Shulk. I'll start collecting them up. You two hold on a sec.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's full of Ether Cylinders... Hey, why do we have to come all the way here to get them? Isn't there an Ether Cylinder fuelling station in the colony?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well. Refining the ether takes a long time down there, and sometimes cylinderisation fails. And there are so many cylinders here for us already. It's more reliable than making them ourselves.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right. And Colony 9's Anti-Air Batteries and mobile artillery are standardised for these cylinders, so they can be used straight away.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I see. You know, this place is in good condition considering it's ancient.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It might be... That there's some form of technology being used to preserve it. It's just a shame we don't understand its secret.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk...?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But I'll solve it one day and show you. If it's just technology that someone created in the past, it's not incomprehensible. We'll come to understand it one day.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't go trying too hard. We can come and get Ether Cylinders whenever we need them. Besides, it's a good place for Defence Force training.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, so good that you didn't even want to come here without Shulk to back you up! Anyway, did you collect the cylinders?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yep. All done. Thanks.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Just come by yourself from now on.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shh, be quiet...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are they Mechon?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't know! But it looks like we'll have to destroy them!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? In that case, just leave them to me!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora, are you OK?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm fine. How about you?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm all right. Thanks to you and Reyn.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What on Bionis were those?! I've never seen anything like them.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Could they have been Mechon?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. I think they were something left by the civilisation that built this vehicle.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They didn't seem like Mechon to me. But why did they only show up now?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't know. But they were probably built to protect this place. They might have been activated in response to something... But I don't think that something could have been us.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Please, let's go back. I don't wanna be here anymore.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Me neither. And we've already got the Ether Cylinders.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's going on?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Listen. What is that?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That sound... In the sky! It's a...!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This can't be!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No way!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Mechon!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How? Didn't my brother destroy them all a year ago?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Could that defence mechanism have responded to the Mechon?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Let's get back to the colony!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Come on! They're eating people!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's horrible...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is Dunban OK?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! Go and check on him!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Heads up, Reyn!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If this thing wants a fight, let's give it one! See? Didn't stand a chance!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's not that easy! We've disabled it, but only for now. It'll reactivate soon! Where's Dunban?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He's gone! I can't find him anywhere.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What?! He ain't fit enough to face these things!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn! Let's get to the lab!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The lab? Of course! The Monado's there!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Exactly. The Monado can take out Mechon.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The colonel! The guys! The colonel... The guys... I'm gonna destroy every last one of those damn Mechon!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! The entrance!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No! We'll never get in there now...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wait... Let me think here... Reyn, Fiora! There's still the mobile artillery!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right! If we recharge it with those Ether Cylinders we collected, we can blast our way in!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's in the Residential District!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Great!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? All right! This is it! Time to avenge the colonel and the boys! What the?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! More from behind!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn! Looks like you and I will have to cut a path through them.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Looks like it.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! Reyn and I will open up a path. Then you can run through.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You two can't do this by yourselves! I wanna fight as well!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get through! We'll be right behind you!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But Shulk...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A year ago, Dunban and the Defence Force fought hard to protect the colony and all of us Homs. Now it's our turn to repay them!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Please, Fiora.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk... Reyn...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't look so worried. We'll just get rid of these ones. Shulk won't get a scratch!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. I believe you.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Go now, Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Huh?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You take care too!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Of course! Looks like she trusts me after all!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I told you. That was a close one.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You were never cut out for this stuff. You go. I'll take care of things here.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're too out of breath to persuade me.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Tell me about it.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn, behind you!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get outta here, Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't be stupid! Hold on! The Monado!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry I kept you waiting.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Whoa yeah! The Monado! So this is why you weren't at home. I thought so! This is what I was waiting to see!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ready, lads?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nice one, Dunban! You didn't waste any time on them Mechon!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Where's Fiora?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Residential District... We said we'd meet her there.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Looks like we'll have to take the long way round.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? All right, then we cut through the Commercial District!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban! You can't take any more of the Monado!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But I must! I don't have a choice!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn's right. You can't go on like this.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban. This time... It's my turn.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, no! It'll kill you! Shulk!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's happening?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What the?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wow. Shulk's pretty awesome!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How can this be? Shulk is using the Monado.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What was that?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! More company!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn! Dunban!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I got your back!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, do you feel all right?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm OK. But there was something strange. Just now, it was as if I could see into the future. Is this another power of the Monado?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? See into the future? What are ya saying?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are you certain? Shulk!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I see. I remember Dickson saying that the Monado had a hidden power. Could this be it?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't think about it now! Just believe what the Monado showed you and fight!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Got it!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's massive.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That Mechon... It has a face?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That don't mean nothin'!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's right! Not when we have the Monado! The Monado! It's not working!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oi! What d'ya mean?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How can that be? The Monado should cut through Mechon with ease!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is that light? Other Mechon don't have that. Could... Could that light be why the Monado has no effect?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Reyn! Get down! Stay back! I'll take it from here!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No! You can't take any more!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everyone. Get away, right now!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What did I just... Fiora! Get back!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I won't let you hurt any more people! We will save Colony 9!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! Get out of here! Run!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You want more?! How?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! No! I'll kill you! Die!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Get back here!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No! Fiora...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The breeze feels so good.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. I'd forgotten what it feels like. I never thought it could be so quiet here.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're spending too much time with Reyn. You're getting used to all the noise he makes.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, maybe.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's so peaceful. You know, Shulk, I hope every day can be like this, always.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey. Have you been to see Dunban?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I just can't do it. You got more guts than me.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not at all. It was him that consoled me.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I guess that's the type of guy he is.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. Even without the Monado, he's the strongest person I know. Uh...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk. How are you holding up?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm fine. But...you...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I will shed no tears.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Huh?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A year ago, I felt the same sense of deep loss that I do now.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Battle of Sword Valley.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? After that battle, many of my friends did not make it home. While I was being brought here on that stretcher, they were all I thought about. But I decided I would not cry. Everyone who died in that war had something they wanted to protect. Family, friends, loved ones, their home... So they fought to protect them. And we won. No matter how painful, no matter how hard, it's nothing to be sad about... I decided that there and then.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, Fiora would tell you the same thing. She wanted to protect us. Or rather, she wanted to protect you. And you're alive now. So I will not cry.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Remember the gift of life that Fiora gave you, and treasure it.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I...I can't say that I understand. But...I hope to, some day.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That is all I ask. Believe me, I am always just trying to understand.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? 'Treasure the gift of life that Fiora gave you.' He's one of a kind, that Dunban.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I've made a decision.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Huh?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? My purpose in life - I will pursue that faced Mechon.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They attacked our colony, killed Fiora. I will find that Mechon - find it and destroy it. Destroy them all! What are you laughing at?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry, sorry! It's just a bit weird. I never thought you'd be the one to say it!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So you agree?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? 'Course, man. I'm just surprised you came out with it first!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You thought I'd try and talk you out of it! 'That's not what Fiora would want!' That sound right?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. Something like that. I thought you'd give me a hard time.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? In my head, there are two versions of me. One of them is saying that. It's telling me, 'Listen to what Dunban said.'", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What about the other one?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It keeps shouting, 'Make them pay!' 'Destroy every single one of them!' And it won't stop getting louder.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That doesn't sound like you. Sure it ain't my voice in there?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Might be! It's a bit of a loudmouth!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There you go then! So when are we heading off?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right now.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Perfect. Right then.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look after yourselves, boys. As soon as this heals, I'll be right behind you. And then we will seize our destiny. Together.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's all very well going after that metal-faced Mechon. But shouldn't we have some kind of plan?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How about checking out Colony 6?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Colony 6... The only other Homs colony left.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Colony 6 is on the way to Sword Valley, where there's supposed to be a Mechon base. If that's where they came from, maybe the people in Colony 6 saw something.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Good point. They might even know something about that metal-faced Mechon. So we go past the Mag Mell Ruins and up through Tephra Cave. Then we should arrive at the Bionis' knee.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. And if we can get to the knee, it ain't far to Colony 6, right?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sounds like a plan! Let's head to Colony 6. This door... It was closed when we came past before, but it's open now.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Maybe it was programmed to open up in case of Mechon emergency. The way to the Bionis' knee is just ahead. You ready?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, let's go. An ether lamp.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't traders use these things as guideposts?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. We can follow them to the Bionis' knee.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. But if armed traders need guideposts, it must be pretty dangerous in here. Let's keep our wits about us.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Definitely. What the...?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look at the emblem. They're traders from Colony 6. No wonder it's been so long since the last delivery.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn, their injuries...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They weren't made by no Mechon. It was probably the monsters that live here. Man, that's grim. I don't wanna go like this. Not even killed by Mechon, just some monsters in a cave.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They probably had families...children...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Maybe. It wouldn't surprise me. But why do you say that?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No reason. Reyn, shouldn't we return them to the Bionis?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh, right. What's born from the Bionis is returned to the Bionis. That's the way of the Homs. That was way harder than I thought it'd be. I'm just about ready to collapse!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Let's take a rest. If the monsters in here killed all these traders, we need to be at our best. I'm wide awake, so I'll take first watch.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thanks, man. The nap'll do me good. Shulk. My turn.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Awake already?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Didn't sleep a wink. And I still feel like I just did one of Vangarre's drills!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Heh.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey... Why do you think the Mechon attacked? Are we just food to them? Or, what, did we do something wrong? Sort of reminds me of the battle between the Bionis and the Mechonis. I wonder if it's anything to do with that?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well... It's hard to believe that living things are just a source of energy for machines. There has to be another reason.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Mechon killed Fiora.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You know what? I'll never forgive 'em. I don't care what their reason is.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hmm. When it happened, the Monado showed me that Fiora was in danger. But I couldn't save her.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's not your fault. Just 'cos the Monado showed you some future, that don't mean you could do anything about it. You did great. You fought them off. I couldn't have done that. You know, I've been thinking about it. Why you can use the Monado, I mean. Dickson told me. You're a survivor from the Monado expedition team that went out 14 years ago. There was a blizzard or something and your mum and dad died. And then Dickson found you and brought you back.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That sounds right. I was pretty young, so I don't really remember anything.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is that why you do it? Why you're always helping Dickson with his research and trying to figure out the Monado?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Maybe. Part of me does see it as something to remind me of my mum and dad. But mainly, if it really is the sword that the Bionis used to kill the Mechonis, like in the legend... I want to work out its secret. That's the real reason.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I've got it! You were chosen. By the Monado.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What? Chosen?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't you see? Not even Dunban can handle it. It ain't chance that you can and he can't. I'll take the next watch. You get some rest.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK, I'll try. Night, Reyn. I... The True Monado?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What're ya playing at?! Give us a hand!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm sorry, Reyn.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't worry about it. It looked like you were having a nightmare!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Really? The True Monado? Was I dreaming?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's with you? We'd better get a move on.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It wasn't a dream. Was it a vision? What should I do? I could tell Reyn. But... I don't know...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What on Bionis are those?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Monsters' egg sacs...I think... But it looks like there are Mechon parts inside as well.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Man... What kind of monsters are they?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Probably some type of Arachno... Reyn! Get back!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Argh! Urgh! Ahh!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn! No! If that vision comes true, then Reyn...! I've gotta find him!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You things just don't give up, do ya?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn! I've gotta hurry. If I can get up there, I should be able to reach him.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Where are ya?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn! Reyn!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's too many of 'em! I kill one, and ten more pop up!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn! No! Not that way! Reyn!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's this?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The power of the Monado?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look out!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Glad one of us figured out these things would try an ambush. Let's do this, Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Looks like the Monado works on more than just Mechon. I gotta say, that's pretty awesome!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn... I just realised something.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Huh?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The future I see... It isn't set. I think it's more like a warning.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A warning?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah... A warning about what will happen. What will happen if I don't do anything, or if I can't do anything. So I can use this power to change the future. And that's exactly what I intend to do.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You've got my vote. And if you really can do that... I think Fiora would have liked it too.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right, let's get moving. We're nearly at the Bionis' knee.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wow!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No matter how many times I see this, I never get used to it.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? On the other side of those clouds...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yep. It's our enemy. Mechonis.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Our enemy...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If we just came up the Bionis' shin...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then this must be its kneecap, right?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yup. Which means Colony 6 is up ahead!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Looks like we can climb up there.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Great! I love a good climb. Shulk! Look over there.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Smoke...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Maybe someone's got a fire going. Hope they're cooking up something good!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's hardly a good spot for a barbecue! Come on, let's take a look.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Someone's left a buggy out here.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's strange. Who would just abandon a buggy in this place? And it's pretty new.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is it brand new?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not brand new. But it's in very good condition. You wouldn't just abandon it. So what did happen to the driver? There's a boy! He's being attacked by monsters!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You saw it happening? Where?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't know! But it was near some water.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Near water... But what made you have a vision all of a sudden?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Maybe it was triggered by touching the buggy.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well, we'd better find him. Let's search everywhere round here where there's water!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Over there! You all right, kid? That can wait. Go! Get outta here! Leave these guys to us.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Let's do this!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ready when you are!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. It should work now. I fixed the circuit, but it's out of ether. Change the cylinder and it'll be as good as new.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I think it's time for the introductions. I'm Reyn. He's Shulk.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Pleased to meet you. Your camp?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How about it?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Let's take him up on the offer. I'm surprised there's a Homs camp here, but they might have some information.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I suppose.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Juju, can you tell us how to get there?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then what? Got it. Now, let's make a move.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That gear. You must be survivors from the Defence Force! Is Colony 6 OK? Did Gadolt make it?!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hold on. What're you talking about?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We've come from Colony 9.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Colony 9? Oh, so you're not from Colony 6. Thank you for helping Juju. I'm his sister, Sharla. Did you now? Well, all right. I suppose that's only fair.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Did something happen? To Colony 6?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Actually, we're heading there ourselves.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Colony 6 has been... Our home! It's been occupied by the Mechon. I'll tell you about it inside. Follow me. We had already fought off the Mechon a year ago, at the Battle of Sword Valley. It left us with a false sense of security. The Colony 6 Defence Force didn't even notice the approaching Mechon. By the time the air-raid siren sounded, a swarm of Mechon had blackened the sky. They ate people and burned our buildings. Me and Juju dedicated ourselves to evacuating the children and elderly. I don't know what happened next.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's just like what happened to Colony 9.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They attacked your colony as well?!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. It's good that you managed to evacuate so many.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We have Otharon...the Colonel... to thank for that. Him and Gadolt.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This Gadolt...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He would have been my husband by now if not for all this. Cheer up, you two!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Er...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We can't lose hope just yet! I'm certain Gadolt and the other soldiers are alive. They're still fighting. I can feel it.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hmm?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You bet! We're up for some revenge. I bet we can even get your colony back!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There you go showing off again...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Juju! The people here need us! How many times do I have to tell you? Even if that's true... No, especially if it's true! We cannot expose the camp to any more danger.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Kid! You oughta know how Sharla feels. Watch your mouth and have some respect! Maybe I was too hard on him. Shulk?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn, you really remind me of Gadolt when you get angry.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I do?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt's taken care of us ever since we were young. I always saw him as a big brother really, but he was more of a father to Juju... He'd call him 'kid' whenever he told him off, just like you did.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't think I'm ready to be someone's old man just yet... Shulk? Did it happen again?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You had another vision?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh no!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No! Juju! The buggy's gone! He's going to Colony 6 on his own!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Stupid kid!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We have to hurry. Something bad's gonna happen.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What did you see?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A deep valley... Everything's engulfed in flames... There's a black shadow... It kills Juju.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is it the Mechon with the metal face?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Where does it happen? Is it near Colony 6?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm not sure. I think so.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Let's get after him, Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hold on a second! What was all that about?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I know you won't believe this... but Shulk can see the future.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The future? That's not possible.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's what I thought too. I still can't explain this. But that vision will come true unless we stop it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So you're telling me Juju's in danger?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Believe it or don't believe it, that's your call. But I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for Shulk's visions.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Juju... OK. I can't say I believe you. But what have I got to lose?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I like the way you think!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sharla, you're...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No, nothing.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What are you doing? Let's go and find Juju!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? When you talk like that you sound just like Gadolt! That's how I know it's not worth arguing.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What am I, some kind of Gadolt substitute?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That thing kills Sharla too. I saw it in the vision. But I can't stop her coming with us. I don't know how I can protect her. But I have to do it. I WILL change the future.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sharla, do you know which way Juju went?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There are quite a few ways to get there from here, but he's in a buggy, so I think he'll take Raguel Bridge.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Raguel Bridge?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's not far. It's a really old bridge. Built around the time Colony 9 was founded.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. Let's make that our next stop.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sounds like a plan! Sharla, you stay back. Leave any monsters up to me and Shulk.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What, you think I can't pull my weight in battle? I've got field experience as a medic. If you get hurt, I can use ether to patch you up.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nice! I'm always getting roughed up. You'll be a big help! Hey, Sharla! Look!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's Juju's buggy!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Juju!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is it?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's Juju!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Is he OK?! Tell me!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's a Mechon... It's taken Juju!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? When?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm not sure. But I don't think we've got much time.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You said you saw a deep valley, didn't you?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's a place like that just up ahead. And it's even on the way to Colony 6. That must be the route Juju's taking.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You sure? No other deep valleys round here?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not as far as I know.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well, Shulk?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Let's move. That has to be where Juju is.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is this the place you were on about?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This is it all right. At the end of the road there's a path to Colony 6.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But there's no sign of Juju. If my vision was right, he should be around here somewhere.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm sure he would have gone along this road. I just hope nothing's happened to him yet.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Any chance he went up that way?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's not safe around here. I doubt Juju would go off the beaten track if he could avoid it.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Got it. We'll search along the road.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Juju! Juju! Hold on, I'm coming!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wait! Sharla!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Juju!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Another new symbol's appeared on the Monado! Can I save her?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk?!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Its tentacles could come out from under the ground at any second. One false move and you're done for. Wait for my order! Reyn, you got my back?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? 'Course! Leave it to me!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Amazing! I didn't know you could do that!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's not me. It's the power of the Monado.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's right. And the light swirling around us... That's the Monado 'n' all. Sharla! Let's move! Is it down?! Get back here!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's up there! Let's go after it!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Juju! Are you all right?! I'm so glad you're OK.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey! Looks like we changed the future! What's up?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well, it's just that... That can't have been the Mechon from my vision.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, weren't it supposed to be that one with the face. I guess we changed more than we expected! Shulk?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. Something's not right.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Juju!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No! It's not him at all!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But this one's got a face 'n' all!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What? It spoke! Juju!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Juju!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You pile of junk! Let him go!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn! Better watch your back!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Got it! Cheers, Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why? Why can't I use the Monado?! It's only the ones that have faces. But... I can still see what it's going to do! Just like before!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Leave these to me! Go take him out!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Got it!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Now!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right! It's just bouncing off 'im! Shulk! Look out! You! You're gonna pay!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Juju... Gadolt! Otharon. But... Promise me. Promise that you'll meet us outside the colony. I... Just make sure you get out of here alive! Gadolt. A promise is a promise. And until I see you again, I will protect everyone. Juju! Juju! Where are you?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey there. Are you all right?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The sleeping princess awakes. Had us worried there for a minute.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How long have I been out?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Huh?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How long have I been unconscious?!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Four hours, I'd say.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I've gotta get out of here!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hold up!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Mind if we go with you?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're going to bust into their base, right? We want a piece of them too.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Really...?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Truth be told, we were gonna leave without you. But the thing is...I get roughed up a lot and we don't know anyone else who can use ether.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I... Thank you both. It's been a while... And it's just... I never imagined I would go back to Colony 6 like this. I'm sorry. Lost myself for a minute. We can get to Colony 6 from the valley where Juju was taken. It's this way.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This is Colony 6?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's like a fortress. Did people really live here?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So much has changed... It's only been a month.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We'll find Juju and then smash some metal!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wait! We can't just rush in.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We could enter through the mine.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Mine?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's a massive ether deposit under the colony. The first settlers here built right on top of the mine. That's how we got our colony. The mine is like a network of tunnels. It's much more complicated than the colony streets. They can't have figured it all out in the space of a month.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? She means it's the best route if we want to remain unseen.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're catching on.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Great! So how do we get in?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Through the Drainage Outlet. It's just up ahead. Guys! Kill the noise.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A Mechon.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can't believe they've taken the mine too! That means the Defence Force and residents are... Oh no, Juju!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Keep it together, Sharla! Don't start panicking now.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You said yourself, they can't have seized the entire area, right? I bet you they're holed up someplace safe. Juju is alive, and we're gonna find him.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's why we're here. You can count on us.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes, it'll be fine. Reyn... Shulk... Thank you. An Ether Rifle? Gadolt!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sharla, wait!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt! Otharon!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's our cue, Reyn.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh yeah!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sir. Isn't Gadolt with you? Sir. Sir, what about Gadolt? Gone?! What do you mean gone?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Some of the people in Colony 9 got eaten...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry. Forget I said that.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are you sure? You can count on me. What?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You say something, Shulk?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. It's nothing. Forget it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hurry it up, slowcoach!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's wrong?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What can it mean? 'This is for you.' Is Juju already dead? Or is he going to be killed? Is that why Otharon... But then... What does that mean? If we keep moving, is Otharon really going to die? No!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's wrong Shulk?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's not it! I... It's just that... Listen... Maybe we shouldn't just rush in head first.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We got this far.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I think we should observe them and plan our attack afterwards. It's just...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sir! What's got into you?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A vision again? Don't tell me, another death?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I knew it. The Shulk I know doesn't just chicken out for any old reason.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This vision... Was it like before?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Kind of. I saw an underground ether river. And Otharon...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? An ether river. You know what? That sword lets you see the future. All that power and you still keep getting it wrong.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Better to use my brain than my fists.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, I may rush in head first, but at least my head's useful for something.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK, OK. I get the idea.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I ain't done yet! You're useless on your own, Shulk. That's why we're here.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn, I...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Next time you have a vision, you tell us. We bear the burden together, as a team. You have a vision you don't like, we'll change the future together. Got it?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Got it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What was that! Say it like you mean it!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I got it, all right! Next time, I'll tell you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He's right, Shulk. You two saved Juju once before. I know we can do it again. I believe in you.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thanks. They're right. We'll change what happens. Anyway, I didn't see Juju and the others dying. There's still hope.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We're here. The Central Pit.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Where are they all? I don't see anyone.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We'll take that lift.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm ready to mash some Mechon!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah! Juju, Otharon... Just hold on!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No... They're gone. So whose blood is... Oh no!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, isn't that...?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's him all right. He's the one who took Juju!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Juju and the others! Tell me where they are! Juju!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Murderer! Xord? So you have a name? What's he talking about?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt... The others... I swear I won't stop until I've scrapped each and every one of you!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get behind me!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn! Sharla! We are Homs. And we won't just stand here waiting to be eaten! How about this! It's the same as before. The Monado's useless against this guy. No! We'll never get to Juju at this rate. I've got to think of something! Otharon, don't do it! At this rate, even if we save Juju, Otharon's gonna be...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You see a vision you don't like, we'll change the future together. Got it?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Change the future. Yes! That's it! Reyn! You grab Juju!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, what are you doing?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Juju! Wake up!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sharla, leave the rest to us. Hang in there you old fool!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Otharon! Hold on!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What a shot!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We can change our destinies. Otharon... You won't die here. Not today. Get out of there, quick! It's giving way!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He's gonna...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But I... This isn't supposed to happen. Otharon!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That was close! You wanna hurry up? My arm's about ready to drop off. Save the thanks for Shulk and his vision. As soon as I saw an ether river, I knew this had to be the place.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Juju... You're safe now.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What did I tell you? You and me can make anything happen.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, you were right. I didn't really do anything. I couldn't have done it without you guys.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Time to head back to the camp.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We'll need to get Juju some medical attention.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's a freight elevator on the next level. From there, it's an easy route out of the mine. As long as it's working...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We'll know that when we get on it.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You make me laugh.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well, I'm right, ain't I?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're absolutely right. We need to move on and stop worrying about every little thing. Come on, guys.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Good. Works perfectly.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You see! What did I say?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We're all impressed.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, why've we stopped?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't know. But I think we're about to find out.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not him again.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This one doesn't give up!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This is our chance, guys.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Did we get him?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? True power? What do you know about the Monado? The truth? When you became like this? What do you mean?! Xord!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get back! We smashed that bronze idiot. Now the people of Colony 6 can rest in peace.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. Are you OK? Thank the stars you're all right. Just outside Colony 6. Thanks to Shulk and Reyn we destroyed that thing. But not everyone made it.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Forget about it, kid. We settled the score.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes, but there's still no sign of that Mechon with the metal face. He's the one we're really after.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's him! Metal Face!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not just him! A whole bunch! And tons of 'em look like Xord! This one can talk 'n' all!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Talk all you want. Because those words will be your last!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm gonna...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How did you...?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry to have kept you. Looks like we were just in time.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's no end to them. Where are they coming from?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can take the smaller ones. But the rest'll be like fighting Xord over and over!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If only the Monado would work on these things!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Focus, Shulk!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look out!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You may be able to block a projectile. But let's see if you can block this!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You OK, Dunban?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What are you? That light... Everyone! Fall back, now!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Now's our chance!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We must be outside the tower.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What or who are you?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You will pay for what you've done! You will know the pain and suffering you caused the Emperor and Fiora! Another one... You're not getting away!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get back here!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, Reyn, let it go!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You've got to be kidding! He's the one who killed Fiora!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Know your limits. We'll get another chance.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fine.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That thing saved us. Whatever it was.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wait... Dickson? Dunban? You're the heroes who risked your lives a year ago, in the battle to defend the colonies.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban, Dickson, thanks for helping out back there.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't believe we did anything.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What was that thing?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A Telethia. So that's what it's called.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A mystical beast that protects the Bionis.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So, what's your plan from here? Follow that metal-faced machine, I presume?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What else? He's gonna pay for what he did to Fiora.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well then. There's only one place he'd go. Galahad Fortress in Sword Valley. A year ago, those things were building a huge fortress, right in the valley. Tactically, it's an excellent location to launch attacks from. I feel there's a strong chance they've now finished building it. That would explain why both colonies were attacked recently.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So it's settled. Bash down a fortress and smash some metal brains!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Easy, Reyn.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's somewhere else I need to go first.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But what could be more important than... Wait... You saw another one.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I was somewhere very high up. I was fighting at the peak of a huge tower. Fighting Metal Face. I heard a voice, and then the Monado's power was unleashed. His armour instantly gave way. The Monado doesn't work on Metal Face at the moment, but if that vision comes true...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Can you remember anything else from your vision?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I remember a huge horn. That's it! As I fought Metal Face, I could see the Bionis' head.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Prison Island?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The High Entia are real? I thought they were a myth!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The High Entia? I'd dismissed them as folklore as well.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Have you ever met one?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wow! Dickson, man, you're just full of surprises!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Stop your whining. You do it 'cos you enjoy it. And you make a tidy profit. Well then, Shulk, what's it to be?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We'll head there.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There are alternatives. We could abandon the colonies, find a place the Mechon will not discover and live in secret.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I realised something when we were fighting Xord. Wherever we go, they'll follow. We can't run from these things. We must fight on.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I see. Then I am obliged to join you.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You want to come with us?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Scared I'll get hurt?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No way! We know you're stronger than anything! Right, Reyn?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You bet!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I've recovered a great deal since we last met. And that miserly old coot over there made me this. Sharp, light. Perfect for cutting through steel. Show me a Mechon and I'll slice it in two. I might not be in peak condition, but I'm useful.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can't thank you enough.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We're in it together now.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You can count on us, Dunban.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So you keep saying... We're at the bottom, so I guess the only way to go is up.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The lower back... I've never seen anywhere like this!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wow... I've never thought about going inside the Bionis.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You really know all the fun spots, eh, Dickson?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We'll push on. No matter what.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everyone, look. It's a group of Nopon.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What d'ya think they're up to?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They must be here for a reason. Let's go and ask them.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Good idea. This lamp... It has a very strange glow.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Good for them.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The breeze feels so good. It's so peaceful. You know, Shulk, I hope every day can be like this, always.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You will pay for what you've done! You will know the pain and suffering you caused the Emperor and Fiora! Dickson. I owe it all to you. If you hadn't found me that day, I wouldn't be here now, discovering the world. Don't be. I don't remember much at all. But I know that my mum and dad left me it. The Monado was their final gift to me. At least, that's how I used to think of it. That's why I wanna discover its true power and help defeat the Mechon. But so far I've just been creating piles of Mechon scrap. This sword... There must be some way... Sorry, guys. Didn't sleep a wink.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right then. Time to move on. How far now?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I understand. Thank you for everything. No, it's OK.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I want to help Shulk. The Mechon must pay for what they did. And I'm sure Gadolt is still alive somewhere. If he is, I have to find him. Are you sure?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No way, kid! You just need to shape up like me! You'll do us proud, kid.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Good luck, Juju. Dickson, are you leaving too? Yeah, I guess you're really needed at the colony. You can bet on it! We won't let the colony down.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thanks for the heads-up, Dickson. The lift don't work!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Looks like it's been broken for a while. We'll have to find another way up.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Another way? You don't mean climb up there?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We may have to.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Come on, you can't be serious? Why'd someone build a lift that don't work?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No complaining! Let's start looking for a place we can climb up. Reyn...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ready to go, Shulk?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. But just hold on a minute.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is it, Shulk?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's about the Monado. I'd like to ask your permission to use it a little longer.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why ask me?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Monado was your sword. But...I need it to achieve my goal. So...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't sweat it. You are far more skillful at wielding that thing than I ever was. Keep it. It's yours. Besides, I have a new sword. That old coot had the decency to forge this one for me. I owe it to him to make the most of it!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You've fought your way this far. That is proof enough the Monado has accepted you. Don't take my word for it. Believe in yourself, Shulk.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Believe in myself?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Never lying down, never giving up. That's our pride and strength as Homs. And we have to make sure those metal monsters know it.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're right!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Time to move, people. This Prison Island Shulk saw in his vision isn't getting any closer.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is this place?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's giving me the creeps.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? At a guess, I'd say we're inside the Bionis. What is it, Shulk?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nothing. It's just that... It feels like the Bionis isn't really dead.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wait a minute, Shulk. If the Bionis starts moving around, things won't look good for us! Let's just keep moving.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No, Aizel. Do you really expect me to leave you, run away and save myself? I will not. I cannot return to the capital with this monster still standing! Aizel! Hogard! Aizel! Hogard! Garan! Damil! Bestow the light of your life unto me!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who turned up the heat?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I've never seen such a dense forest.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Me neither. How much further?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This must be the back of the Bionis. If Shulk's vision is right, we've still got a long way to go.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You mean go on in this heat? I'm sweatier than a Brog's armpit!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We'll have to search for the best route. Sadly, until we find a way, we'll have to put up with Reyn's stench.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sharla!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We must be outside the tower.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Father!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What or who are you?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You will pay for what you've done! You will know the pain and suffering you caused the Emperor and Fiora! A silver-faced Mechon... And who was that girl? These visions show me people and places I've never seen. If only I could find out what they mean. We could use them to our advantage.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look over there! A rope bridge! It looks Homs-made.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not Homs, Nopon. Though a lot of them have settled in our colonies, the Nopon are originally native to Makna Forest.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Do you think they'd know the way to the Bionis' head?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can't say. But walking around in circles isn't going to achieve anything. Our best bet is to look for their village. Over there!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, are you OK? You!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk? What's wrong? Another vision?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Kind of. I'm not sure. But first, she needs help.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're right. Let's look for somewhere safe.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There. I see a clearing under a giant tree. We can easily watch for anything approaching.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. I'll carry her.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? She hasn't sustained any serious injuries, but her condition is far from stable.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Do you know what's wrong with her?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Her symptoms suggest ether deficiency. It's well-known that Homs are strongly affected by ether levels in the environment. But I've never seen symptoms like this before. A sudden drop in ether content in the surrounding atmosphere causes a reaction. Symptoms range from fatigue to nausea, but in this girl's case...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What can we do?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We're gonna need Water-type Ether Crystals. I'll load the crystals into a cartridge to shoot from my rifle.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're gonna shoot her?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No, silly. I'll fire them into the air and the dispersed ether will heal her.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's what I thought.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But the problem is the crystals. We can't just use any old crystal, they must be as pure as possible. This area must have a water source nearby. We should search there first.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I spotted a waterfall a little way back. What do you think, Sharla? Would a waterfall produce pure crystals?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can't think of a better place.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then it's decided. I'll search for the crystals.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, you're not going on your own!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'll be OK. I need you to look after the group. We're short on water too, so I'll fill up our flasks.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, good idea. Take care man!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who are you? Hello. Alvis? Um. My name's... How did you know that? I know you from somewhere... What are they? Alvis, get out of the way! I'll deal with this myself! From the left? Then I'll go... How?! Now from above! It can't be! I saw its movements before it struck. How can it...? Telethia? You know about my visions? How could you possibly- No, Alvis! Stop! You don't know how to- A new symbol! That was amazing! What was that light? I... control it. By the light of the Monado, I will stop them. Thank you. Hey, wait a second! More importantly, where on Bionis did you learn to use the Monado? A girl? Alvis. How do you know so much about the Monado? Who are you?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's Reyn! I'm over here!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, we looked all over for you. Thought you'd been eaten by the forest!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry, Reyn. I got attacked by Telethia. If it hadn't been for Alvis I wouldn't have survived.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Alvis? Who's that?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'll introduce you. He's the one that... Alvis? But he was...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's no one here.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm telling you, he was right here. He even taught me how to unlock a new power from the Monado.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Just you and me, Shulk. Ain't no one else around. You probably passed out from dehydration and dreamt this guy up. Come on. Wait 'till the others hear this.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He was here, Reyn! I didn't dream it. I'm not lying!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK, OK. I believe you. And while you were having fun with your imaginary friend, did you find any ether crystals?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. Good quality ones too.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Perfect. Come on. We should hurry them back to Sharla. Hang around here long enough and we'll get whacked by an imaginary beast!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm not lying! Alvis... Who are you?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? An enemy that renders your visions useless. This forest holds many surprises. Not least creatures we've never seen before. And now we know there is another who can use the Monado.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can't wait to meet him.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So you weren't just having a sneaky nap then?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm just saying. You and Dunban are the only ones I know that can wield the Monado. How would this guy know how?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. Locked and loaded. Everyone, stand back.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wow. Unbelievable.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? She's coming round. All thanks to our medic.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are you OK?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Where am I?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everything's fine. You're gonna be...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get your hands off me!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, watch it!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Forgive me. I did not mean to...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry if we surprised you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are you the ones who helped me?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well, something like that.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Excuse me. My name is Melia. Forgive my indiscretion. I have not had the pleasure of coming into contact with a male Homs.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Coming into contact?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey Shulk. You're creeping this lady out.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shut up, Reyn!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This large one is far worse.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Me?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia, is it? How did you get here, then? What, is there no one with you?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I must apologise, but my situation does not concern you. And I shall not be divulging anything to common passers-by.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Duly noted, your ladyship. But if I were to be so bold, I'm guessing that you didn't come here alone and you weren't just taking an afternoon nap.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And what, may I ask, are you doing here? It is rare to see Homs venture this deep into Makna Forest.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We're travelling to the head of the Bionis. We've got a long journey ahead of us.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The head of the Bionis?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We were just figuring out how to get there when we found you.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I see. Then permit me to return the favour by aiding you in your quest.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Really?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There is only one path to the head of the Bionis. It is the path that leads to Eryth Sea.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So this Eryth Sea is at the head of the Bionis?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If you would be kind enough to escort me out of the forest, I will show you the way.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You'd do that?! Thank you, Melia! I'm Shulk. Pleased to meet you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, ah yes. Likewise.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? She's a bit high and mighty, but she's a Homs too, right? Why is she here alone?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ain't got a clue. Ask her yourself. I'm not good with her posh accent.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We shall travel to the Nopon village.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nopon village?! That's where we've been heading. We reckon it's our best chance of making it to the top.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Since inhabiting the region, the Nopon have been a great help. You can travel to Eryth Sea from their village.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's settled. We'll make our way to the Nopon village.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Very well. The Nopon inhabit a giant tree. If we follow this trail, we will be safe. This is the entrance to Frontier Village.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So this big tree is where the Nopon live?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I wish to speak with the village chief. Will you permit us to enter? I shall take you to the village chief. Follow me. Nopon of Frontier Village! Melia Antiqua has returned. I request an audience with your chief. Chief, will you hear my request?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Bird Lady?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They are at one with the Bionis. They sacrificed their lives so that I might escape. But this is not my reason for coming. These Homs need your help. Will you be so kind as to listen to their request? They require safe passage to Eryth Sea. I have unfinished business in this region. Once these Homs are safely on their way, I shall be on mine as well.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That girl...something's troubling her.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We found her half-dead and all alone. But I don't suppose she'll tell us the reason any time soon.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Maybe we can help. I'll go and talk to her. Melia. You're welcome to come with us. Is it true? Were you alone in the forest?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That thing must be stopped by my hand. This is my pledge to those that have died.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wounded by a girl... You don't mean you're going to fight the Telethia?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How do you know of the Telethia?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? When I went to collect the ether crystals, some Telethia attacked me. I managed to destroy them and get away.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You defeated Telethia?! Who are you? The Monado... So that sword can...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? To tell the truth, they were the Telethia's spawn. Someone told me the primary Telethia is healing somewhere in the forest. It was you, wasn't it? You hurt the Telethia. Melia?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Telethia escaped from our homeland, and I am tasked with killing it. It cannot remain free. For the sake of my people, and the Nopon, it must be stopped.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia, we can help you defeat it, if you like.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Out of pity?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why, then?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's just... I...I want...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Speak, Shulk. Or I shall be forced to summon the Nopon chief to interpret for me.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I would like to help.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What could you possibly gain from aiding me?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I saw it. At the top of a black tower, you and I were fighting together. Fighting that faced Mechon. I also saw you fighting a huge Telethia.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It threw me the first time 'n' all.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Forgive me, Shulk, but what are you talking about?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk can see visions of the future.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? See the future?! And you expect me to believe this rubbish?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Believe what you want, lady. Same as I tell all the non-believers.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That'll be me then.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh yeah. In any case, the only reason we got this far was 'cos of Shulk's visions. If Shulk says he saw you in a vision, then you must be important to whatever happens next. And if you're tough enough to fight a faced Mechon, you're all right in my book.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You've got my vote. A lady should not go unaccompanied onto the battlefield.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Excuse me! I am quite capable of dispatching the beast alone! I require no assistance of any kind! Chief Dunga, I...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You do know we're listening? A Nopon hero? Now this I have to see!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't be like that. Let's meet him first.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Watch out!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get off me!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? To you!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right in the... Take this, furball!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? New Hom Hom friends! Meet this year's legendary Heropon, Riki! Riki live to serve!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A Heropon, you say? Not sure where you'll come in handy, but the more the merrier. Shulk, are these Telethia as strong as they sound?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. They're quick as lightning and can read your mind.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A mind-reading giant bird. No problem.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can see their movement through the Monado, but even that's not enough to get the better of them.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And we're going up against the daddy version. No one blink for a second.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Eyes wide open!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And don't forget that Melia is our only chance of making it to Eryth Sea. If anything happens to our guide, it's on our heads. The Telethia is our target, but don't forget about the person standing next to you.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban's right.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I am in your debt. My weaknesses are all too apparent.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No worries, Melia!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki's friends, listen to Riki! Dinobeast is big and scary! Friends get ready, friends help Riki get ready!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You want us to get equipment for you?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki's friend right. Hom Hom clever! Friends meet Riki when ready. Then friends and Riki leave together.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Big attitude for a furry footrest. \"Dinobeast is big and scary!\" Great. That'll come in handy.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is it just me or did we suddenly become Nopon mercenaries?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ready to go! Come new friends, Riki's adventure begins!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki? You do know where the Telethia is, don't you?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Of course Riki know! Melly! Riki hear you hurt Dinobeast!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I did. But only a little.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? When Dinobeast hurt, Riki know it go to place with ether crystals. Friends and Riki go to place with crystals. Then we find Dinobeast! Chief tell Riki! Chief always right!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So you do know a thing or two about this monster. Guess we'll be searching for some ether crystals then.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki? Why are you the Heropon?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why? Because Chief Dunga choose Riki!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He chose you? So you weren't chosen from birth?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Friend wrong. Chief choose by instinct!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? By instinct?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why friend surprised? Chief have sharp instinct. Chief be village seer!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So that's how you became the Heropon? Can't argue with that.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But he is kind of...compact...for a warrior hero.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki owe lots of monies to village. If Riki defeat Dinobeast, village promise to forget my debts. So Riki like being Heropon! What is this? Riki never see before! This not Riki's Makna! Riki never see before!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? To think it has caused this much damage.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do you mean?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are you telling me the Telethia did this?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Telethia absorb and drain the surrounding area of all its ether.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's it! The Telethia is sucking up all the ether, which is causing the natural environment to change.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, the Telethia can read your mind. Expect it to know what you will do before you do it.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I know. I'll aim for its antenna and stop its ability to read my thoughts. With the Monado at our side, it doesn't stand a chance.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It is much more powerful than its offspring. Do not expect it to fall so easily.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I won't. But we have to trust in the Monado.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk has only met Telethia once, and they were merely the spawn. So why is he so sure of himself? Is it confidence or a trust in something? Yes. It is trust. He trusts in the power of that sword. What did he say it was called? The Monado? I see...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Stick together everyone.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dinobeast! Big as Riki imagined!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Telethia! I take this chance to bring vengeance for my brethren and fulfil my duty! Shulk! I will trap it and cease its movement. Strike when the time is right!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Be still!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh yeah! She's nifty with that staff.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I knew it. She can control ether energy without using catalysts or rifle shells.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I've heard that such people exist. But I never thought she would be one. Shulk, Reyn, Sharla! Protect Melia at all costs!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? On it!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What the?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dinobeast grown back thing!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You've got to be kidding me!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's no good. My ether shots are having no effect.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Its regenerative power is too much!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It is all right, Shulk. Destroying the Telethia is beyond us! We should cut our losses and mourn those who perished.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Never, Melia! The men you lost... I can tell they were dear to you. I know only too well that desire for revenge. And the crushing pain of losing those close to you. I can't stand by and let another person experience what I have. This monster is going down! I'll trap him with the Monado! Then the rest of you, hit the Telethia with everything you have!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thank you.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ready?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Now! Dunban!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Bite on this!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Now, Melia! Finish him!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Brilliant thinking. Even though the Telethia can absorb large amounts of ether energy and regenerate at an incredible rate... Absorbing so much energy caused it to implode.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who would have thought? Brute force wins again. Nothing like an old-fashioned scrap. Dickson would have been proud.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It was the only way I could think of. If there had been another way...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't listen to Dunban. Soon you and that Monado will be unstoppable.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's like at Tephra Cave. It was almost natural, instinctive. The Monado responded to me, and I harnessed a new power.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You'll get your chance, Shulk. We'll turn that faced Mechon into scrap.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I know. That's what keeps me going.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hogard, Garan, Damil, Aizel. Are you there? I did it. It's dead. Did you see? I thank you for your aid in my cause. Justice has been served.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're welcome. Besides, it was mostly you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dinobeast! Heropon Riki ready for round two! Hey! Fight over already? No! Riki not know!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm afraid it's all finished.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We couldn't have done it without you, brave little Heropon!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki brave! Reyn also a little brave. Riki happy happy!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look at him. Barely hit a toe and he gets all the praise.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Let him have his glory. A few days ago the villagers wouldn't give him the time of day. Besides, won't you miss him just a little bit?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Chief Dunga! Riki beat Dinobeast! Does Riki still have debt? Riki never hear this! Chief lying! Chief make up prophecy one minute ago! Riki mad! *groan*", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dada? Riki, what on Bionis is going on?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Friends, meet Riki wifeypon and littlepon.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You have got to be joking!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wife and children?! Riki, how old are you?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki have 40 years! Friends look puzzled.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not puzzled...just surprised!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki will! OK, Oka. Riki happy to join friends!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn happy too! Come on, furball.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Indeed. Thank you, Dunga. My thanks for your gracious help.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Chief Dunga is very fond of Melia.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Same Hom Hom, different world. Not fair if you ask me.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Chief Dunga. Will you kindly grant these Homs passage to Eryth Sea? It is my promise to them. You are too kind. The Chief has spoken. You should depart for Eryth Sea at once. Prepare your things and see me when you are ready.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia. What will you do now?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I would like to repay you for your help. Permit me to act as your guide to Eryth Sea.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Of course! We'd love you to.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But I must warn you. Eryth Sea is vast. Do you know where you wish to go?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's a dark tower at the head of the Bionis. I saw it in a vision. That's where I must go.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A dark tower? Then we need not search at all.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So you've heard of it?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Heard of it? I have seen it. A dark tower at the head of the Bionis. Only one place fits that description.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So you know it?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I believe what you saw was Prison Island.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Prison Island. Dickson said the same thing.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Indeed. Melia, have you ever been there?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I have not set foot upon the island, but I know of it. Prison Island is sealed. No one may enter without imperial sanction.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Imperial sanction? That means we'll be needing someone to grant us entry. I've heard that Eryth Sea is home to an empire ruled by the High Entia. They might be our best chance.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You are knowledgable for a Homs.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sanctions, empires? Anyone help here?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A sanction is permission from someone important. An empire must be a place ruled by an Emperor. In other words, we need an Emperor's permission to enter the island.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This Emperor... Is he important?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Long before we Homs built the colonies... A group of so-called royal-types or imperials ruled our lands. Think of them like the heads of our colony. But with much greater influence and power.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Now I get it. Dunban knows more than a textbook!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are you kidding? That's first year Homs history, Reyn!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I might have slept through that class... So when do we get to meet these High Entia folks?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You are so... Forget it.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? First we must travel to the imperial capital.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We'll see how easy it is to see this Emperor.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? My promise was to be your guide. I will not break it.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia, isn't that the...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The shortcut to Eryth Sea, yes.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is it?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Friends, jump in ball! All go to Eryth!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Jump? In that? You're nuts, furball!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You have nothing to fear. This will take us to Eryth Sea.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who would've thought Eryth Sea was right on top of Riki's village. Dive deep enough, you can reach their tree!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Perhaps you should try?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Might do. Haven't decided yet.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is something wrong?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Aren't you curious... About why we're going to Prison Island, I mean?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It is not common for Homs to visit this region. You may have good reason, but forgive me. I do not pry into other people's business.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's definitely bugging her, Shulk.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How dare you! You clown!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's OK, Melia. We're not strangers anymore.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well, I... You are right.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So then you'll listen to our story?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. Tell me why you are here.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Basically, it all started when...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I see. I had heard about the Mechon assault on the lower regions, but did not know the situation was so grave. How lucky we are...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, what's that?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is that...?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You are looking at Prison Island.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So that's Prison Island...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. And that is the imperial capital, Alcamoth.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's not just me, right? A floating city is a bit weird?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Built with superior defences in mind.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Incredible. What technology makes this possible?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I do not know. And I have never had the need to.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You don't know? It doesn't freak you out?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You can eat bread without knowing how to bake it. Makes sense to me.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You will need imperial sanction to enter Prison Island.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We will travel to the capital first.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And how do you expect us to get up there? Fly?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There is a transporter up ahead. We can use that.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We've been deep sea diving, now we're gonna fly? This place gives me the creeps. But I guess we don't have a choice. Right, onwards to the capital!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Still...", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is it, Dunban?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's a sight to behold. Those look like anti-Mechon defence systems.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who are these guys?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are those wings on their head?! They must be High Entia!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Lady?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Huh.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thank you, Captain. These Homs and this Nopon are my guests. See them safely to the guest quarters. Give them anything they need.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's going on?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I have no idea.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia, are you...? Melia.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I cannot speak now. But I shall fulfil my promise.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I understand.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I will arrange for an audience with the Emperor. Will you wait?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We won't move an inch. Trust me.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? My thanks.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? 'Lady Melia', he says. Shulk, you thinking the same as me?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Whatever her position is here, Melia won't let us down.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm sure you're right.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Huh?!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? More of these guys?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I must report the Telethia's defeat to His Majesty and request entry to Prison Island. Shulk is depending on me. I must hurry to the Audience Chamber. Melia Antiqua, First Princess, has returned, Your Majesty. Your Majesty. But, Your Majesty, I failed to return with any of the subjects you entrusted to me. My inexperience cost them their lives. Emperor. Your Majesty, concerning such debts, there were others who aided me. Shulk and his companions? Shulk's weapon... Do you mean the Monado? Why?! So you intend to keep them confined? Father! I mean... Your Majesty! I assure you Shulk is of pure heart! I... Brother. Me? And not you? I don't know what to... But the soldiers... I am not fit to rule. I should visit their families and beg for pardon. I know, but it does nothing for the guilt I feel. I will. I am to be crown princess. I understand. You think so too? The seer could free Shulk?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Idiot birdbrains! What did we do? A fancy prison is still a prison.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What happened to Melia? I don't see her locked up in here with us.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Exactly! She's in on this!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, any thoughts here?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia won't let us down. She promised to take us to Prison Island. And she's not the kind of person to break a promise.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK, Shulk, you win. I believe you. And if you believe Melia, then no arguments from me.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Alvis?! What are you doing here? Is Melia OK? We didn't mean to cause her any trouble. You don't mean...? Hold on, Alvis. I need to ask you-", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The life of the rich! So where are we going?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Anywhere but here. I'm bored of this stuffy room.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK then.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki find Melly for Shulk!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki! Wait!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What guard want?", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If you're after Alvis, he's gone.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What happened?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sounds like they need our help.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk and Riki go help! Riki and friends help people in trouble!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Of course. We're happy to help.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Soldier man not worry! Heropon Riki is here to save the day!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I accept. If I am to lead the High Entia despite my mixed heritage... If I am to succeed the throne, then I accept what must be done. Yes, Your Majesty.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Looks like we got them out of a scrape!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Riki tired. Riki sleep in castle now.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Good idea. Let's head back to the capital.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The sooner the better!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everyone's gathered outside.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How come we didn't get invited?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looks like some kind of ceremony...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So that's the High Entia Emperor.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorean Antiqua.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And there's the lady herself.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's her.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? She's a princess?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Took you long enough.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Her silver spoon accent was a clue, but royalty?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't doubt that was Melia, but why the mask?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't know... But she's different from the other High Entia.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How do you mean?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melly not like other Bird People. Melly like Hom Hom friends.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You might be right. But there are things at play here we can't understand.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wait a minute!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You'll give a Homs a heart attack shouting like that.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We've got no time to lose! Melia needs our help!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Again? You had another vision, didn't you?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What did you see?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Out with it already!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Excuse me. We ordered room service an hour ago.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who are these guys? More of them!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia's brother? Kallian! Melia is in danger! She'll be killed at an altar if we don't find her soon! That's why we have to find her! Now!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I thank you for escorting me. I must prove my worth as the next ruler. And I am no less prepared to sacrifice my life than those that have fallen before me.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You can't seriously think that? This is your sister! This is Melia!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Easy, Reyn.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But Dunban!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This ritual holds a special significance. It is wrong for us to interfere.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't like it!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But am I right in saying that the rules of this ritual affect only High Entia? And if some strange Homs happened to get involved, it wouldn't cause a problem? Or is there some rule that prohibits Homs from entering the Tomb? Then look at it this way. I don't need to know how big a deal this ritual is to your people. What I do know is that your sister's life is at stake. Cut us a break, and we'll save her. My name is Dunban. I'm sort of the protector of this Mechon-bashing band of Homs. You know a lot about a battle you never showed up to. I was only joking! You had your reasons. I can see that with all these defence systems you don't really need to fight.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? One thing before we enter. Alvis, you can see the future, like me? But you're a Homs... No. My visions appear suddenly, without warning. At first, they're obscure. Then as it gets closer to the event, I start to understand.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not much use as a seer then, are you? A coincidence?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But I've seen you use the Monado!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The ancestral altar lies deep beneath the seals. What trials await me, I wonder? I must not lose focus! Melia Antiqua. I have come to be judged on my legitimacy to the throne by the ancestral spirits.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's so cold.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There are remnants of ancient spirits in here. This is no ordinary chill.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well, what does this do?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Descendant? Are you the progenitor of Antiqua? But he passed away thousands of years ago. I do not understand. But I do not suspect any falsehood in your words. Joy? What do you mean? Wishes? I still do not understand. Is this...? Revered Ancestor... I... Explain yourself. Only imperials are permitted to enter this place. Mother's subject? I...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who puts a great big hole somewhere like that?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What a mess, Reyn.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Friend not clever touching button!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm with these guys, Reyn.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How was I supposed to know that was gonna happen? What about your visions?! You'd think the two of you could come up with something!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You know it doesn't work like that.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Pair of fortune-telling frauds.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You got us into this mess! And it's not the first time either.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki agree with Shulk!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why's it my fault all of a sudden?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This time it is your fault.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Precisely.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. We can't waste another second. Melia needs us.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That is a big ball of something.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It look fun and sparkle!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's not attacking us at least.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's happening?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, look at that!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Another defence mechanism!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? At a guess, we're looking at the Tomb's guard.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We're not getting past without a fight.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everyone, Melia needs us. We can't let this thing stop us!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No problem. Time to break my record. Anyone would think we're not wanted! Are we ever gonna find her?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Somebody mean Reyn!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shut it, hairball. It was just a button!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We've got to hurry. There's no time to lose! Melia... Half Homs? Melia!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk?! A Telethia in the Tomb? Keep clear! The Telethia is destroying itself!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Almost bought it.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Alvis. Thank you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why did you come?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Monado gave me a warning. That you were in danger. I'm just glad we made it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, Shulk! Whoever that was, is gone.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So they escaped. Shulk. Everyone. I thank you. You saved me.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki smiley smiley! Melly all safe! All thanks to Heropon!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's not how I remember it, cheese ball.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Mother... Your Majesty. But if it hadn't been for Shulk... Brother... I will!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki and friends help save Melly. Riki very happy!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We're all relieved. But something's still bothering me.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is it?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why was Melia chosen as the crown princess? Shouldn't Kallian have been the one to ascend? And her foe in the Tomb clearly opposed that decision.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You have a point.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Kallian is more than a worthy candidate. What reason could they have for choosing Melia? And why would Kallian go along with this?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's a mystery.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Finally! He's gonna let us into Prison Island.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. Not at all. I too must apologise for meddling in your customs. We should not have interfered. Yes. The Mechon devastated our homes, and we lost many loved ones. It is. I do not want to hide our true intentions. Our very existence is at stake. What is it? Yes, it is told to us as children. The two fought and died, killing many creatures in the process. Their remains became our worlds, bringing forth new life on Bionis. That's how we were made. Alvis told me the same thing. But why is this happening now? We used it because we- You're talking about total extinction. Then you'll help us? Your Majesty, we need imperial sanction to enter Prison Island. Will you permit us entry? I saw it in a vision. We will fight a faced Mechon. They must pay for what they did. Is it connected to the awakening of the Bionis? I understand. This is not our homeland. If you decide not to let us go, I will accept your decision. It's OK. Yes? It would be my honour.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wow! Take a look at that! A High Entia air show!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Bird People fly higher than Nopon birds!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They've got some neat tricks. Shulk, I think that's Melia up there!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? By the authority of our divine ancestors, I, Melia Antiqua, am honoured to accept the responsibility of becoming your next benevolent ruler. Should I be deemed unworthy of this calling, or fail to protect the ancestors or the Bionis, I promise here and now to throw myself on the mercy of you, the people.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Most majestic. That fragile girl in the forest is a distant memory.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But which one is the real Melia?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No, it's not like that. They're one and the same girl. I think.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So they've got a new crown princess. Three cheers for Melia.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right, but we're still no closer to that murdering faced Mechon.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Once we reach Prison Island, we'll get our chance. I've seen us there. It must be true.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, man. Maybe we can still persuade big wings? Melia's crown princess now, I reckon the Emperor might change his mind.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Maybe.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn. The Emperor's request was clear. Give him time. There's more to this island than we know. Things are at play here that reach beyond our understanding.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dundun right! Riki and friends visit Melly now!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey! The adults are talking, pops!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki want to see Melly. Riki think Melly sad too.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? She might like the distraction. All those stiff ceremonial duties... You decide, Shulk.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki say yes!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You came to see me?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki's friend Melly! Melly look amazing before! Riki so proud!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Really? It all happened so fast.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What a stunning garden! The arrangements... The fountain... When the colony is up and running, can I steal some ideas?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? My late mother adored this place.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Late mother? But I thought your mum was...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Her Highness the First Consort is not my birth mother. Members of the imperial family must take two wives: one Homs, one High Entia. My mother is the Second Consort. I am half Homs, half High Entia.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melly live here?", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes, Riki. Since I was young. I cannot walk outside as you see me now, so this garden gives me much relief.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's wrong with how you look? Who cares if you're half Homs? You'll always be you.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Their way of thinking differs from ours. Different ways, different morals.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So that's why you wear a mask in public.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. Shulk, in less than an hour there will be a banquet in the palace. I would like you all to come.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki so hungry he could even eat smelly Orluga!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There'll be plenty to eat.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Finally some decent grub! I haven't eaten anything since breakfast! What's on the menu? Any High Entia specials?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Do not embarrass me at this dinner!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Expectations lead to disappointment. We are talking about Reyn here.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What? That's the last time I sit next to you then!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I have much to prepare. I will have someone call for you later.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We can't wait.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is there something wrong?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're a funny one.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Emperor! It can't be!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's the Emperor!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Father?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Another vision?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! What did you see?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? On that tower... On Prison Island...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What does the siren mean? *gasp*", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Tell me! What happens to my father?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He... It follows my last vision. We're on Prison Island. Metal Face and your father are...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Prison Island? Why would Father go there? No! I must go to the palace. I must stop him. I will go to the Audience Chamber!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wait, Melia! We're coming too!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Brother! Where is Father? The Imperial Staff, it's... So Father has gone?! Kallian! Why did you let him go alone? Father...!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Alvis... You saw something? If he knows, then why? But that doesn't mean...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, we're going!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Respect? Destiny? We don't need rules to tell us when to save the people we care for! You too, Melia. Don't give up on him. The Emperor, your father, is going to die!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's only one thing to do. Are you with me?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Of course!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We are Homs. Do what you must. But your laws don't concern us. No apologies needed. So, Melia, what's it to be?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We go to Prison Island! Prison Island is just ahead.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Do we need to use the transporter?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We do. But first we must unlock the seals.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Seals?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We'll need to unlock two seals to reach Prison Island. Then a door will appear before us, showing the way.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Got it. Move, everyone! Mechon! And something we've never seen before!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Big fish coming!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Can anyone explain what this thing is?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I believe it's one of the oldest creatures on Bionis. I have only seen them as fossils discovered around the capital. To find that they were trapped on Prison Island...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Was it protecting the island?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That would imply it's sentient. I believe it's responding to something primitive.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Primitive?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It doesn't care who or what we are. Its instinct was to defend against anything. But we'll never really know.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We're losing time here. We still haven't reached the island.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki go to island!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Whoa! Big door! Whatever needed this door was massive.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ah! Dinobeast!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's just a statue. Don't freak us out like that, Riki!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is this a person? I can't make it out.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This may very well be the appearance of my forefathers. The legends tell that they differed greatly to how we look now.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And this is what they looked like?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wait a minute. I've seen this thing somewhere before...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dinobeast! Dinobeast!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You might be right. It reminds me of the Telethia as well.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Did your ancestors build this island?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. The stories tell of this place existing long before my people. No one knows for sure, but we think our forefathers are the ones who sealed it.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I wonder what's hidden inside. Well, we'll know soon enough, I suppose.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There! An engraving by the forefathers. I've seen this engraving around the capital. Many researchers have tried and failed to discover its meaning.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, Shulk. That symbol.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah... It's similar to the Monado's symbols. There must be a connection.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Connection?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The sealed door of Prison Island. It is said that only a true successor to the throne can open it.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then the Emperor must be inside.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I believe so. Forefathers. I, your descendant Melia Antiqua, stand before you. For the sake of our world, release the seal! Just like at the Tomb...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's it doing?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Aren't we going to help?!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Please do not worry. It is necessary.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is it, Shulk? Get a move on. You saw it, right? Us bashing that tin man's head in!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hold on a second.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Here we go. I knew you'd start overthinking.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's not much time, Shulk. We've got to go now.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sharla's right. We'll miss our chance to take that murdering Mechon down. And save Melia's father too!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I... OK.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We must be outside the tower.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are we here?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This is it. This is the place I saw.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Father! Father, who is this?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who are you?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Check that guy out!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is this...? You waited for him? But I thought our forefathers imprisoned you here?!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You made the Monado?! But why are you imprisoned?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're telling us you beat the Mechonis with that tiny thing?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That can't be true! Our forefathers would have had better reason!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shackles? You mean... These shackles... They must be the reason the Monado can't hurt people as well. Does that have something to do with the faced Mechon?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't do it, Shulk!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But Melia, why?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Something's not right. The forefathers must have had good reason to seal him!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I need that power. I thought you of all people would understand!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I do...but... It's just...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hold on a minute! He only said he'd release this new power. Sounds like a good idea to me.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia, please understand. I must do what I set out to. The Mechon must pay! I will. Zanza!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's him!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Metal Face!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How did you know we'd be here?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A silver-faced Mechon!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Mechon! You will pay for what you've done! Give us back Fiora! Give her back!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What or who are you?! How do you know me? He moves like... But that's impossible!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Emperor!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Father! No, Father. Father!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Emperor! Emperor. I... failed you. Zanza! You're alive! Give me the power I need! What?! Zanza. Mechon! It's not over. The people of Bionis will never let you triumph!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's changing form!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You will know the pain and suffering you caused the Emperor and Fiora! What?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look at 'im!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Monado has changed!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is that a Homs?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No way!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! You're still alive!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Zanza. You have not changed at all. That is clear. But still, I cannot...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wait!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? My mission is complete. Returning to base.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! It's me - Shulk! Fiora! We were too late again. I saw it. I knew it would happen.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why? Why did this have to happen?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Father... Don't say that! I don't care how improper it is. Let me cry. Why does it have to be me, if all it takes is to be half Homs? But...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Your Majesty.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Father, no!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia, come with me.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk...I...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You'll have plenty of time to think about your empire and your people's hopes. If you need me, I will be at your side. But you are an individual. You are Melia Antiqua. And you can't let them get away with this!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're right. My foremost concern is making them pay.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Friends act strange! Are friends sad? Riki sad too because of empty belly.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki, we already ate. Us Homs don't get upset just because we're hungry.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not hungry? Hom Hom must have small bellies. Riki jealous!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We've got to get our minds off this somehow. Dunban's locked himself away ever since we came back.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is it because of the girl who was operating that Mechon?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia. How are you?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do you mean? If you are talking about Father, I'm fine. I have no choice but to the look to the future.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're stronger than me, Melia.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Do not mock me. More importantly, it is time you tell me who she is.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We've known her all our lives. We thought she was killed in Colony 9.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? She didn't even recognise us. She's not the Fiora I remember.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looked a lot like Fiora. But if it was her... Then I can't imagine how Dunban feels.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What did he mean?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora is Dunban's sister.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I didn't know!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is this Fiora...important to Shulk?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Important?! She's more than important! She's the reason we're out here!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If that really was Fiora, why didn't she reply to me? Fiora... I'd better talk to Dunban. He'll know something. I've been looking for you. So this is where you were.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk? Apologies. Was everyone worried?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Of course. Me especially. It's just... I've been thinking about Fiora, and I can't help wondering...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wondering what?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You saw how Fiora acted. It was like she didn't even recognise us.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. It's unsettling. But Shulk, don't get me wrong. I'm not sad. Even if she doesn't recognise me, I'm glad to know she's alive.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You see, Fiora was born many years after me. And not long afterwards, we lost our father to a Mechon. It was left to me to protect and raise her. Almost like a father.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I was always jealous that she had you as her brother.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ah yes. You and Fiora used to be inseparable.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I need to tell you something. I always thought, if Fiora were to be with anyone, it should be you.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What? But Reyn hangs out with her just as much as me.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, he does. But Fiora doesn't like him in that way.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh, I see.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He's a nice guy. Reminds me of myself when I was his age, all reckless and hot-headed. Probably why he's not right for her. Listen, Shulk.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A lost life can never be returned. But she's alive. It doesn't matter that she's lost her memory.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah... I guess you're right.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora and I have spent our entire lives together. The memory of that can't have disappeared completely. It's up to us. We have to help her remember. Help me, Shulk. Help me get her back!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You know I will.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. Let's go tell the others.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, they're back.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Have you gathered your thoughts?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. Sorry to be a nuisance.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk...you too?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yep. All thanks to Dunban.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm...glad.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You think something happened?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We won't know until we get there.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's fine. Is anything wrong? Your Highness, does this mean...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Brother...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I need time before I make a decision.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I do not believe that to be true. Shulk has other people to consider.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That wasn't like you, Shulk.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm sorry.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You know you can talk to me.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's Fiora. That's why you're hesitating.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Knew it! You wouldn't think twice otherwise.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I just don't know.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Find her, Shulk.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia...I...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I used to believe my father did not love me. Until the day he died. If you do not grasp the importance of loved ones until after they are gone... That is simply too late.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're right, Melia. I've made up my mind. I'm going to get Fiora back!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You don't have to do this. I'll go and look for her myself. The burden should be mine.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. I want her back as much as you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Leave the ambassador stuff to me, Shulk. I'll probably make a mess of it, but we're a team. You can count on me.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I am afraid that is my duty, Reyn. I am of both High Entia and Homs blood. I am the crown princess, and of mixed heritage. Thus, I am best suited to carry out this task.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That means we won't...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. I will remain here. We must say goodbye.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is that what you really want?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. But promise me when you find her, you'll come back. I'll be here waiting for you.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't know what to say. Thank you. It's probably a good idea if I go and tell Kallian myself.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I am sure he already understands. Besides, it's likely that the ministers are harrassing him at this present moment. We should spare him any further inconvenience.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then this is goodbye.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. Come back as soon as you can. We are in great need of your help.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Got it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ahem...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why are you still here?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Listen. I'll keep an eye on Shulk for you.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Whatever can you mean?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's a risky strategy, letting Shulk go off and just hoping he'll come back to you.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk and I are merely...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, yeah. But remember! The longer he's away, the more chance his feelings for you will fade.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But-", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Once we find this Fiora, I will personally whisk him back here in a heartbeat. Don't give up!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I appreciate it.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Great! Don't worry, Melia - I'm on your side!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Brother? It's not what-", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm sorry, Your Highness. About your offer... We must...humbly decline.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I stay because I must, Brother!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's two Melias?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn wrong! This Melly smell different.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Kallian... Speak.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are you sure? Your Highness, that means a lot to me.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That is one cool prince.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If only someone had his sensitivity...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sensitivity? I'm sensitive...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The jury's out on that one. That's a relief.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thank you, Kallian. I will keep her safe.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Regent, I accept your request. I will return victorious with Shulk.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Do you want to come?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then there's no point in wasting time.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We'll join you as soon as we can.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You see. Now we're getting some respect.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We're back to this again, are we?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? See you soon, Kallian.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If Colony 6 were in better shape, we could have taken a pod from there. How are we getting there?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So that's our route.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ready as we'll ever be!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Zanza is not dead. I feel it. Our tragedy unfolds once again. Indeed. I do not doubt that Egil, too, is aware. However, why free the Monado? Zanza must realise it is now a double-edged sword. And what reason could he have for choosing the boy? What is this? I am experiencing feelings for the boy? Vanea. Your swift repairs are appreciated. I wish to see that boy again. To meet with the one who wields the Monado. Is Egil aware of my reawakening? Then there is no need to worry. I shall meet the boy. Besides, the Monado will draw him to me.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I could go for a hot cup of Dickson's homebrew right about now. We're not built for this cold.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki hate cold!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This can't be nice for Riki. He's from Makna.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A little further down is Sword Valley, right? Me?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki see it! Bigger than big tree in village!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ruins? I wonder who built them.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Alvis? This the place you meant? Been away?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Throw hot water on ice!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, nice one genius!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And we can use this rock to melt the ice?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sounds good. Start looking for a geyser, everyone.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The letters are worn and difficult to make out. But it's definitely the language of the High Entia.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They look just like the lettering on Prison Island.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If only we could... ...just walk inside.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This place...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Something up, Shulk?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No...it's just... I feel like I know this place.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm not sure, but... I thought I had it. I can't seem to recall...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are you all right?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What? Must be tired. Don't worry. Wait, you mean...! So this is where the Monado was kept? My dad took it from here... Have you always been able to see the future? You told me you are from a long line of seers. Did you have the ability from birth? And the ceremony was held right here. I hadn't really thought about it. After I grabbed the Monado, I just saw things. You mean the Monado. My visions, under the same principle, are there to disrupt the future. The future would be changed. Is that how Zanza planned to defeat the Mechonis? But why go to such lengths? What happened all those years ago? I used to only believe in what I could see. My home, my friends, the Monado itself! I knew those things were real. Are you saying I should stop?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can't feel my face or feet. What do you think?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn not tell truth! Reyn's snoring make Riki think of Orluga!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oi! I don't snore!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That Mechon! It is you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, that's Fiora!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Young Heir to the Monado. We meet again.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora? Is that my name? Then you... You know this body?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So it's true. You really don't remember us at all. Fiora, listen! If nothing else, you must remember your family! That's Dunban over there!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Family? There is family... Wielder of the Monado. There is...a matter I must speak to you about.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What was that?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Metal Face!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Stay alert!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You killed my father!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get him!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get away from her! You!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're disgusting!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? All right. You can have it. But only if you let her go.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But you're-", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is that...?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Mumkhar! I thought it might be, but... You're to blame for all this? You dare ask that of us? Why did you betray us to Mechonis? Why did you kill our friends at the colony? Why?!

Melly hit bad guy in face!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're a traitor, Mumkhar. And you're not getting away. You fought beside me at Sword Valley!

Is the Bionis moving?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is that it?! That's the puerile reason you've killed all those innocent people? Ravaged our home! Never. I will strike you down and all that you have become, you wretched fool. The Monado will stop you. And then you will know the shame of all that you have done, traitor!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That light!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What the?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's not like the other Mechon. Leader of Mechonis. So you're the one who controls the Mechon! Why?! Why do you trap Homs in machines? What do you want from us? Why make us fight for you?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get your hands off her! Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this?

Get it together! Shulk! We ain't got time to be hanging around here! I dunno what's happened to her, but that was Fiora. No doubt about it. You know what that means?! She ain't dead! We've gotta get her back!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get her back... Right! We've come too far to give up now!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then we'll go to Mechonis! And find Fiora!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. We will get Fiora back.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Whoa! What the?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is all that big sword? If is then ouchy ouch!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The sword of the Mechonis.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The entire valley below... The whole thing is its sword!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Something seems unnatural.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do you mean?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look. That flowing light. From the way it glows, it has to be ether. But it looks like it's being drawn in by something.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? By the fortress! It should just be up ahead.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Father once told me that the Mechonis absorbs the ether of the Bionis and uses it for sustenance.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So the Mechonis feeds off ether. Then undoubtedly the ether serves as the Mechon's energy source as well.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looks so big, even from this distance. The fortress must be enormous.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Galahad Fortress - the front line base of the Mechon. The Mechon that attack Bionis must all come from here.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then there's a high probability that he's there. The golden Mechon that took Fiora. We're about to enter the Mechon stronghold. If there's anyone who wants to turn back now...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk. Friend should no split up. No leave friend behind. Riki scared but Riki want go too.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He's right. OK, let's go.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's that?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You arranged this for us?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, it's...!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What are you doing here?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah! I was hoping for some new stuff!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You cheap old man! Yes. They made Mumkhar into one. He was the one who attacked Colony 9. Aren't you surprised?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry? Thanks for coming this far. We'll be fine. We can handle ourselves.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Agreed. We will infiltrate via the ether inlets. If I'm right and the Mechon do feed off ether... Then we're sure to find some form of influx channel. Our objective is to reach one of those channels.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I won't! You take care as well.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Looks like it's just us.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right! We head for the hilt of the sword - Galahad Fortress.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? One year on. Now, at last, we will seize our destiny. Isn't that right, Shulk?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, look! Can we get in through there?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looks as though it's unguarded. It should make for a decent entry point.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Now's our chance, Dunban.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. But don't lower your guard. The Mechon may just be hiding. Mumkhar! How could you? How could you do this to your own kind?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oi, beardy! You're talkin' pretty tough there! Don't be so sure you can take us all on by yourself!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's that sound?!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You scumbag!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's just like with Zanza! Sharla! Look out!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everyone! Watch out for the green claws! And the other ones' spears! There's something different about them!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How can that be?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You monsters!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Mumkhar! You're gonna pay! Yes. This is the power of the Monado! You wanted it, so now you can have it, Mumkhar! Die!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Stop!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get out of my way! Shulk!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's Mumkhar... He's not a Mechon!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Have you forgotten everything he's done? Where is your killer instinct?! Now is the time!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I hate him, Dunban. For what he did to Fiora. And the Emperor. So of course I want to get my revenge!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But... Face Mechon are not like the others. They're people! Like us! Are you really willing to kill another Homs?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. Sometimes needs must!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Even if it's Fiora? What then? When we set out, I wanted to destroy all Mechon. That was my aim. But now... I know that there are people inside. I have to know why. What's the reason for all of this? Why do Bionis and Mechonis have to keep on fighting? I have to find out why!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So, that is your fight?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I will never forgive what he's done. And yet... Your words. They ring true. I feel their weight. We have to help Fiora now. We'll worry about the rest later.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Did you hear that, Mumkhar? We haven't got time to be playing around with you.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Stay back!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Mumkhar! Mumkhar... You went too far, you fool.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? At least he's out of the way. Now we just need to get inside.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They're in there. Fiora and the golden Mechon. Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! What's up?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Did you see something?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You did see something.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? All right. It was the silver Mechon... Fiora. She's definitely inside the fortress.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? All right. At least we know what to expect.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So Fiora is inside. I can't let that vision come true. I have to save her!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Here's our way in.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's no turning back.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We can't let them find us. Let's move!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora's in here somewhere.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Let's get looking. Keep your eyes peeled. I'm ready for anything. I'll trash any Mechon that tries to mess with us! Where are we?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Looks like the control room for an ether blast furnace. There, look at that.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So this is what supplies the Mechon with ether energy.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! What's that?! Looks like fun! Riki want to ride!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We didn't come here to mess about, furball! Time to bounce on!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hold on! If we can stop that piston, we might be able to shut down the blast furnace.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nice idea. Cut off the Mechon's ether supply.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki say we try!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, but how are we supposed to stop something that massive?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If we can stop the turbines driving the piston, it should work. And the turbines should be nearby.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right. Let's search for them.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nice one! We did it!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This should prevent them from mobilising any large Mechon squads for now. Hopefully we've improved the allied force's chances.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hold steady, my brother.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Friends! Here here!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looks like the door's been unlocked.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nice. Let's get down to the blast furnace.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If we're lucky, Fiora might be down there.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, is that?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Spear ones! Loads and loads of spear Mechon!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Stop! Don't you recognise Shulk?! Fiora!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora. Please. Don't you remember us at all?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's no use. Everyone, it's time to retreat.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Got it!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Understood.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Move! Shulk! You all right?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, I think so. What do we do now, Shulk? We ain't gonna last long here!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! Try and remember! It's us! What is...?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oi, what's going on?! What's happened to the Monado?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look out!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm OK.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Wait here!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! Stop this right now. How could you? Shulk came here to save you! Do you hear me? Fiora!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You must run.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! Fiora... Or whoever you are.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Please, run! The machine is not under my control.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not under your control? Is it him?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Egil...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! What have you done to her?! Why make Homs into Mechon?! Why are you making them attack Bionis? Never! Who would ever submit to you?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Forget about him. We have to get out of here.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But... But what about Fiora?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If we die here today, she will be... She will be lost forever.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You chunk of scrap! So it was you who did that to the Monado!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But how can you... Never! If the Monado really is powerless, then why would you want it for yourself? I'll never give it to you! Never!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Egil! I cannot allow this. That boy is at risk. Shulk! Don't let him die! Help Shulk! Help them! Who are you?! Whoever you are... Please lend me your strength! I won't let you do this!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora?! Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Egil... No matter how much you yearn for revenge, I will not permit you to have your way!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No, stop!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Please... Survive!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not good! Let's get out of here!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Where are you?! Shulk, get back here!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora... Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! No!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's been a long time since I last had this dream. I reached out for the piece of scrap metal. And then I fell into the ground. Was I... Was I dreaming? Fiora! What's that? Fiora! Fiora! She's still breathing! Wake up. Come on! Wake up! She needs water. Fiora. You're awake. Do you remember? My name is Shu-", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can't believe it. My first kiss.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You do remember me! Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Of course I do. Shulk. I... I never forgot you, or the others.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then, why?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Because I wasn't me anymore. I wanted to call out, but I couldn't.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do you mean?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? When it happened, when Colony 9 was attacked by the Mechon... I thought I had died. I felt the Mechon's claw rip through me. I couldn't remember anything. There was no sound, no light, no pain. When I came round, I had the body of a machine. And it felt like there was someone inside me.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Someone else? The one who was controlling the Mechon you were in?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes, that voice. But I could still see and hear. I was there all the time. Except I had no control over my body, and I couldn't talk.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And that's why it seemed like you didn't recognise us.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. Inside my heart, I was crying out desperately. But you didn't hear me. Nobody did.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We always believed it was you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's OK. You don't have to say that. I know it would have confused me.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But the person inside you... Do you know who it was?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. I heard her voice when she spoke, but I didn't know what she was thinking. There was something she urgently needed to do. I understood that much.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do you think happened to her?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Maybe she's sleeping. Or maybe she's trapped like I was.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I hope she stays trapped. Hijacking your body, treating it like it's her own.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I guess.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I say good riddance, and let that be the end of it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk? I don't think she's totally to blame.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why not?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? She needed my body for something. I don't know what it was. I just know it was important. I want to help.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why would you?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I knew she was using my body, but I didn't hate her for it. She was kind. She was taking care of my body. I could feel it.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Really?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. And she did everything she could to protect you.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So back when we were fighting...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Against Egil. She knew what I wanted to do and did it for me. So I want to help her if I can. Please, Shulk.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? All right. Then we'll do everything we can to find out what she was trying to do.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thank you.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Welcome back, Fiora.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm glad to be here. What do we do now?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We have to find the others. I know they're alive. I can feel it. Everyone's gonna be surprised when they see you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everyone being...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn, Dunban, and there are a few others we met along the way. Sharla, Riki and Melia. I just know you're gonna like them.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looks like you've been through a lot as well.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, but nothing's gonna separate us now. Come on, let's start searching.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! What's wrong?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry. My body feels a bit strange. I think I just need to rest. I'm sorry.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's OK. We can take a break here. I wonder what happened. After the fortress. Where did the others all end up? The Monado's light is fluctuating. That Mechon really messed it up. But still. I have to protect Fiora.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk? Can't you sleep?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry. Did I wake you?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. It's OK. I slept really well.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You want to eat? You must be hungry.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No thanks. But I'd like some water.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. You should eat. Even if you're not hungry. You need to get your strength back.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No, I'm fine. This body has its uses. I never need to eat. I never get hungry. I just run on water. Don't worry. I prefer my old body, but this one has some advantages. Shulk. You can leave me. It's OK.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I mean, look at me, Shulk. This body is a Mechon body. So I should live here on Mechonis. This is where I belong.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You don't have to do that.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Fiora you knew is dead. Just think of it like that. It's for the best.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But I can see it's not true! I mean... You're right here! I'll never forget how I felt when I thought I'd lost you back at the colony. I should have done something! I thought, if only I had the power to save you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. No more regrets. I will protect you. Besides, there's someone else inside your head. We can't leave her there.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I guess not.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Mechon! No! Not now!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Let me...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! Right. Come on, Monado. Don't let me down. No! I won't let you take her from me! This time, I will protect Fiora! Yes! The Monado's light! I can do this! The Monado... It worked, but... I feel worse than before. Whatever he did to the Monado is... What's that sound? No! We're surrounded!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Where are we?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're up then?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sharla! What happened to us?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't know. I've only just come round.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Where are the others?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I looked for them, but they're nowhere to be seen.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn, thanks.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Huh?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? For protecting me, back there.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, it got rough but at least you got out safe.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is it?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look at me, I'm useless. Can't even keep a promise. I promised Fiora I'd look after Shulk. Stupid...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You promised to protect the guy who protects you? Am I missing something?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? In the old days, Shulk was kinda frail. You know, like a little Bunniv that gets bossed around by the other colony animals. It was me who used to be there, to save him. That's why I promised Fiora. But now look at me.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He's stronger now. And not just 'cos he's got the Monado. I've done all I can to help him. He doesn't need me.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's not the Reyn I know. Do you remember Colony 6?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Mechon were always on the doorstep of our home, the colony. Thinking about it, I realise they were after the ether underneath it.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. I suppose so. If they could stockpile energy from there, they could get to any part of Bionis.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Colony 6 defence force suffered its fair share of pain. And not just physical. Friends and family...alive one day... gone the next. It all became so normal. You end up wondering how you can possibly make a difference when war is so futile. I'm not the only one who felt like that sometimes. But nobody ever gave up. And you know why?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Because you were strong?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We had no choice but to be strong. Everybody had someone to protect. The moment you looked away, you'd lose everyone you loved. So we had to keep looking straight ahead. We couldn't stop fighting.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Man, that's tough. Puts my problems into perspective. I suppose I should get back to being Reyn.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't go doubting yourself, even if things get tough.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're right. There'll be plenty of time to stare at my feet when I'm old and crooked. Get it?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I get it. So now what?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We go looking for Shulk and Fiora! I might be like a third wheel, but I can still lug around the heavy stuff.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Finally! That's the Reyn I know.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Back there, were you talking about that guy Gadolt?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not just about him. Why do you ask?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nothing. Just... You know... Seems like tough competition for a guy like me.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn. Do you think Shulk and the others are OK?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? 'Course they are. They wouldn't die from something like that.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Back to your old self I see! Right, we'd better get looking. What's that sound?!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Someone's in a fight! Up ahead! Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I got your back. We'll turn them into scrap!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Good to see ya. I knew you'd make it, Shulk.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thanks to you!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn! Reyn, it's you!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! She remembers us!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. She's been through a lot.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can see.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If only we could find Dunban.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, he'll be blubbering at the sight of us.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hahaha! I don't think he'd ever cry in front of you two.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So he does cry?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? When no one's watching?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yep. He's always been like that. He's a big softy, but he hates anyone seeing it.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I never knew.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nope! I don't believe it!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Take it easy.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm OK. I want to see my brother. Let's go, Shulk.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If you can't walk, I'll carry you.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm much heavier now.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I've been pumping my guns.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can see! Reyn, you really looked after Shulk for me.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I wanted to, but it feels more like he's the one who's been protecting me.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's not true!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's OK. I know it, you know it. I'm not here to protect you anymore.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But you are here for something.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. What I did just now. It don't matter how strong you get, you ain't got eyes in the back of your head. So I've got your back!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn, you...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn, you're like a whole new person.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do you mean by that?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I mean, it's good you've become so dependable.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Was I that un-dependable before?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Take it as a compliment!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You haven't changed a bit. What would we do without you?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right, let's go. You wanna see my brother cry, don't you?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, wouldn't miss it!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is it?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can hear something.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What? I can't hear anything.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Maybe our sense of hearing isn't strong enough.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Low sounds. More than one. Watch out! Something's here!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Friends stop for Riki! Riki very hungry! And Riki sleepy! If Riki not rest now, Riki not keep going!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We can't have that, can we? We'll rest here before going any further. Melia, do you need to rest?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I am fine.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Good! Break time!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's this?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Heropon Riki have big fight with fish. Riki win. Grilled fish taste yum yum! Dundun eat too.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I thought you said you couldn't move if you didn't rest.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki very tired. But Riki very hungry too.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How considerate of you.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki not understand Dundun!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't try to hide it. You realised Melia was lagging behind. She would never admit how tired she was. That's the real reason you asked. Now that's good fish. Even in this strange place, at least the fish tastes like it should.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki glad Dundun like yum yum fish!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, thank you.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melly is tired, but Riki tired too. And Dundun not look happy.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's this? Am I that transparent?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki want to hear Dundun's story. Riki listen carefully. For Riki is the Heropon.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm not sure what that's got to do with it. Well, seeing as you're here. I'll tell you.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yay! Riki listen.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I have a sister. Her name is Fiora.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki know. She wears silver armour. Shulk look everywhere for her.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Indeed. Shulk and Fiora... Everyone knows they like each other, but they're just not ready I suppose. They are the perfect match, but if they don't hurry up and tell each other...", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Even Riki know that!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I suppose everyone does. But now Fiora has become something else.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? She forget Shulk. She forget Dundun too.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? She did. But, Shulk won't give up that easily. Knowing that he's out there looking for her fills me with hope. I just wish I was there with him...", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dundun take care of them!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hmm?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dundun watch over Shulk. Dundun watch over Fiora. That is all a daddypon can do. Riki make mistake. Dundun not daddypon.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well, I am her older brother.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But just like daddypon, watching over family. Same watch over. Dundun do what he must.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who would have thought it? I never imagined I would be getting such advice from you.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki have big family of littlepon. Riki raised and say goodbye to many littlepon. Riki know some things.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You can say that again. I had you all wrong.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It doesn't look like the others are here.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Unfortunate. I hope everyone is safe.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everyone safe. Everyone strong!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki is right. It is simply a matter of when we will happen across them.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everyone landed in the same area. They have to be around here somewhere.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Friends look here! Riki find it yesterday when Riki go scouting.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I wonder where this pipe leads.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Go go! Riki has feeling Shulk and friends are on other side!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Feeling? Well, I'm willing to give your Nopon instinct a try.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? As am I. The pipe it is.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A village in a place like this!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Guys!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're all right!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. And... We found Fiora.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! Do you remember me?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry if I made you worry.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's all right. I'm just so glad you're alive.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dear brother.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, is that your childhood friend?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Congratulations. I'm glad she is safe.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thank you. I couldn't have done it without you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But how did you all get here? And what is this place anyway?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? These people helped us. This is their home. Machina... You mean, machine people?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So, are you Mechon?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A form of mechanical life born of the Mechonis... Is that correct?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Life born of the Mechonis... So there is life here, just like on Bionis?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Explain to us why you invaded our world. What did we ever do to you?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban, please hear her out.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But...", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? These Machina... They're good people.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora? Ever since she was given this body, she hasn't been feeling too good. But we honestly don't know what to do.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm OK, really.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? For us?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, I'm...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on her.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thanks.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hah! He's massive...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We were told that you were waiting for us.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Request?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It is.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. Although unfortunately we were unable to stop Egil. Do you know him? He claims to be the leader of Mechonis. Your son? You want us to kill your son? That is no small request.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who was Lady Meyneth?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You talk like you saw all this. Ain't this all just an ancient myth? You can't be serious?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The people of Mechonis must have a longer lifespan. Just like we High Entia live far longer than Homs.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I get that, but he can't have lived that long.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But why do you want your son dead? From what you've told us, I would've thought you'd want us to destroy the Bionis rather than kill your own son.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So he wants to do to us what the Bionis did to the Machina?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Didn't you ever try to stop him?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Where is Egil now? I feel sorry for him.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What're you talkin' about?! Did you forget what he did to us?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I haven't forgotten, or forgiven! But Egil's clearly suffered a lot in his life. You don't feel any sympathy at all?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? All I know is, this stinks. Who cares what he's been through?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I understand about Egil. But why us? You should be aware that Shulk's sword, the Monado, has the power to destroy Mechonis weaponry. It's said that it was once the sword of the Bionis. Doesn't the very sight of it make you quiver?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do you mean? Is she sick? That's right. How? But you can treat her, can't you? Please!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's OK. I don't want to be a burden to Shulk. I don't care if I have a machine body. Just make it so I can fight beside him.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A problem? But where? We'll take a look. The beach at the base of Digit 5, right? I think we found it. Is this the Piezoelectric Unit? Linada, will Fiora be OK now? But! You're right. I'll try and get some rest. Thank you for everything you're doing. Yes? I'll go and see him. He wants Egil stopped, and so do we. But I need to sleep on it. Thank you. Umm... Yes, very well. I wanted to...talk about your son. Yes. We agree with you. Egil must be stopped. But we can't act now. Before we came here, we heard of plans to form an allied force on Bionis. Any day now they're going to launch an attack on Mechonis. But it's too dangerous. Egil has made a weapon that could kill us all.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The weapon that Mumkhar was using? The one that shoots green fluid?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He said it can decompose any being from Bionis.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We have to go back and warn them. Before it's too late. Dickson?! What are you doing here? I can't believe you found us.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You know each other? Why did you keep that to yourself? That information is vital to all who fight Mechonis.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So they escaped to live in peace? Somewhere they wouldn't be seen. Makes sense.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So this is where you obtained all that stuff you brought back to Colony 9. I wondered where you were getting it from.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I haven't discovered why, but it disintegrates anything it touches. But only if it's living tissue from Bionis.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK! Let me think about it for a bit. Fiora. Dickson, listen. Yes. What are you fighting for, Dickson? Because he's trying to exterminate the Homs? Really? Will they launch an attack on Mechonis? Prince Kallian said that? Yeah. I think that's the type of man he is. We're going to the Mechonis capital. I don't know. I can't forgive the Mechon for what they've done. But after listening to Miqol, I think there might be another way. Do you really think that?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We won't let Shulk die. Not ever!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! Are you OK to be walking around?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yep!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I have to hand it to her. That Linada's pretty good. And not just with machines. She's also quite familiar with organic physiology.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You went to get the thing she needed to cure me, right? I'm sorry I've caused all this hassle. But I'm fine now. I'll be by your side, fighting to protect you. No matter where we go, no matter how difficult it gets, Shulk will do the right thing. It doesn't matter how slim our chances, Shulk will always stick to the right path.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And don't forget, it's because of Shulk that we're all here, fighting together. I think that shows he has a strong character. Am I wrong, Dickson?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson, we're going to the Mechonis capital. About the allied force... Yes. Thank you for all your help.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Vanea...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is she a Machina as well?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hold on. You mean she's Egil's sister?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And you say she'll help us? I dunno why she'd help us, but... We'll try and find her when we get there.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I will. Thank you. Is that possible?! Thank you, Linada!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't make that face! OK, let's go!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is it? We're in your debt. Linada. We will.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Linada, thank you for everything.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Bionis and Mechonis.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's so different seeing them from this kind of perspective.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We cannot see it from here, but our people are still fighting up there.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's difficult to believe that two such huge things ever fought each other. I wonder how the Machina felt at the time.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Must've been horrible.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Scary too.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fear robs us of reason. Out of fear we commit terrible atrocities and call them acts of self-preservation.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fear gives rise to more fear. A never-ending circle of hatred.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Perhaps that circle can be broken?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fear. It must be what's driving this. What's made Egil act this way.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We're inside the Mechonis.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Just how I imagined it. It's all totally mechanical. It ain't gonna be easy getting up this thing.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Egil is at the top...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's up, Shulk?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look. It's a switch to activate a lift. If we can get it to work, it should take us up.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki want to ride lift!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We can't. There's no power going to it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Boring!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do we do?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well, if we could find the main power supply...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK people, let's get lookin'.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. If we can connect the power to the switch, we should be able to use the lift.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Whoa, don't look down! Anyone know where we are? Other than high up?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Maybe...somewhere around the thigh?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The thigh? You mean we ain't even half way there yet?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Stop moaning about it. Look. We can make camp over there. Let's rest for a while.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora, are you sure you're feeling OK?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I feel a bit like I haven't got used to this body yet. But please, whatever you do, don't tell Shulk about it. I'm sorry, Dunban.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't worry about it. Back when my arm was injured, it was you who took care of me.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'd almost forgotten. It seems so long ago now.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thanks, Reyn.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Doing a spot of maintenance?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yep. The sighting's been a bit off lately.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You know, Miqol let us have some new parts. I could make you a new rifle if you want.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thanks. But I want to keep using this one for now.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, get a clue, man! It's more than just a weapon to her. She can't just throw it away and get a new one.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. I suppose so.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If she let anything happen to it, I bet she'd get a whack from old Otharon.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Doesn't my man ever rest? We never know when the Mechon will strike next. Stop it! Gadolt, it's not your fault. Listen to me! Nobody knew that so many Mechon would come! More people would've died if it wasn't for you! Would their deaths have meaning if we'd won?! Hey, Reyn.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is it?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Do you want to beat the Mechon?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Of course. What you askin' that for?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? At any cost? Even if it means giving your own life?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Giving my own life? No way. I can't do anything if I'm dead. I'm gonna take down the Mechon and survive. And there's no way I'm gonna lose Shulk, Fiora or you along the way. We're all gonna win this and get out alive!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If only we all thought like you.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do you mean?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's charming.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We should get moving. We don't have time to hang around.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn, did you rest well?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah! I feel great!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looks like we're about to re-enter the Mechonis. Brace yourselves.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Got it!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dundun! You OK?", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh, it's nothing. Just my imagination.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are you OK?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? She looks very tired. Should she not get some rest?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thank you. But really, I'm OK.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. We'll find a safe place to rest. We've hardly stopped since we left the village.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki tired too. Riki tummy rumble.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm with you. Time to park our- Shulk", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get down!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A Mechon assault! Can anyone see them?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Another vision? Nice one, Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. It wasn't.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That voice!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's a faced Mechon!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is there someone inside?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do we do, Shulk?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We fight. But don't kill him.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thought you might say that. Sharla!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt! It's you, isn't it? Please answer me! Let me see you! Gadolt! I knew you were alive.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is that Sharla's boyfriend?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt?!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do you mean, Lord? What's Egil done to you?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's wrong, Gadolt?! Why would you say that?! Speak to me, Gadolt! Gadolt! Stop! Gadolt...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sharla!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who's calling my name? A higher power? Like the Bionis? I do just as anyone would do. It is natural to want to change an unhappy future. If that is their will, then I choose to fight. My Monado? Is everyone OK?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That was a close one. I mean, how on Bionis did we survive that? We seem all right.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I dunno. It could be that we were just lucky. But I'm sure there must be more to it than that. Who's there?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A Machina?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are you Vanea?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Vanea? Does that mean you're Miqol's daughter?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Lady Meyneth?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're lying! Gadolt would never try and hurt us! It can't be!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is that because of me?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Mumkhar seems the more likely candidate. His attachment to us was too strong. You could say it caused his destruction.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That Xord one 'n' all.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. It's not true. My Gadolt...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sharla?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Explain it to me. I mean, why does Egil want to make us into Mechon? What's the reason for all this?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I knew it.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Of course. Initially, the Monado couldn't take a Homs life.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It can now though.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Those who share the blood of Zanza? Who is that giant? Him?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What?! Are you saying that Zanza is to blame for Mechonis' devastation?! It's Zanza's sword that I'm using! Does this mean we're enemies?! And if so, why are you...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Calm down!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry...I...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is that your plan? Lead us straight to the gates of our enemy? Deliver us into Egil's hands?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So this is the Mechonis capital.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looks so desolate. Like there are no signs of anyone living here.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It truly is a soulless city.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Here bad place. Riki want to go.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So the Machina built this whole city? Not too shabby.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looks like the buildings have been here for a very long time.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look, Shulk! Dinobeast! Dinobeast eat city!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A Dinobeast? Here?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But how?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It is a Telethia!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looks like it's stone.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why would there be a Telethia in a place like this?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why did the Telethia attack your city? Wasn't the ancient battle only between the Bionis and the Mechonis themselves?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looks like the power's up and running.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora, what's the matter?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everyone follow me.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is that?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looks like it's here. But it's just an image.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No way! Whoa, you're right!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? These are memories of a time long forgotten.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They were left behind by the Machina, before they abandoned this place so that others may know their story.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Her voice sounds like...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? In ancient times, when the Bionis and the Mechonis came into existence, I was born as well. Just as the Bionis had a soul, I came to exist in this world as the soul of the Mechonis. I created my children on Mechonis and acquired this body. They called themselves Machina. And Mechonis was transformed into a world brimming with life. The Machina gave rise to an advanced civilization and built this great city.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This city?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Can't believe it used to be so lively.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They lived their lives in peace and harmony. The gentle Machina worshipped me. Life also flourished on Bionis. The Machina generously shared the fruits of their civilization with the peoples of the Bionis. They believed their two worlds would grow, hand in hand. Then a terrible fate descended on them from above.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is that the Monado?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But why? Why would the Bionis...?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wielding the sword of light, the Bionis attempted to destroy the Machina.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are those Telethia?!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I tried to save the Machina, and confronted the Bionis. And so I confronted Zanza.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Zanza?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The battle waged on and on. Even as our life forces depleted, Zanza and I continued to fight. However, it did at last come to an end.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Giant.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This is when Zanza was imprisoned!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Taking advantage of my final blow to the Bionis, its beings took Zanza and sealed him firmly away. However, the battle with Zanza had greatly consumed my life force. I warned the surviving Machina that the Bionis had not yet been destroyed, and that one day he would be released.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm the one who released him!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I then entered a long and deep slumber, in preparation for Zanza's inevitable reawakening. It's all clear to me. What you wanted to do. Stop the battle between the Bionis and the Mechonis.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora. I see now. It was her inside you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But why did it have to be my body? It was all because of our world, because of Bionis, that this city was devastated.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Now I understand why Egil would want to stop the Bionis from reawakening.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I get it too, but how's killing any of us going to solve his problem?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Precisely. What happened to the Machina was a tragedy, but we cannot forgive the Mechon attack on Bionis.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What worries me is the Monado that the Bionis used. It's no different from how the legends describe, but still...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It must hold a deadly power.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But you have used it wisely, Shulk. It has not overwhelmed you as it did me.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He's right! If you hadn't been using the Monado, we wouldn't have lasted five minutes.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But it was Zanza who bestowed this sword upon me. The tragedy of he who wields the Monado? Light? What do you mean? We understand the history of Mechonis now. If he is willing to listen, we will try to reason with him. But if not...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Vanea...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I know Vanea said she'll try to persuade him, but she didn't sound confident.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We have to go after her.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But how do we get to the shrine from here?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Up ahead is a transporter leading to the shrine. But it's inactive. We need to trigger the Verification Devices to activate it. We'll find one at the top of each of the four pillars. If we trigger them all, we can use the transporter.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How Fiora know that?", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Meyneth's memories... She tells me these things.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Do you know how to trigger them?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Maybe my body itself is the key.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. Then let's get searching. Look out!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's him! Gadolt!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's the second time I've sensed an attack without seeing a vision first.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt, stop! Why are you fighting us?! Remember who you are!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's no good! He's completely under Egil's control now. Remember what Vanea told us!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can't believe it. I won't believe it! Gadolt, please! Answer me!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How can you lay a hand on Sharla?! You're supposed to love her, marry her even!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. You always protected me and Juju. This isn't you!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You don't have to do this! Look at Fiora, she found herself again. Whatever you are, you must still feel pain! Well then finish us off! Sharla 'n' all! We all saw you miss a second ago! Ain't you supposed to be a crack shot?! Or did that pile of junk you call a body mess up your aim?! Stubborn idiot! That was your last chance!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He's not giving up. The stories about Gadolt of Colony 6 are true.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Except... he still can't kill her. He's missing Sharla on purpose!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt... You're just like I was. You can remember who you are.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt, please! Don't you remember me?! It's Sharla!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk... Can you still use the Monado?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora? No... You're...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Even after losing all living flesh, a Homs' heart will remain. It is still present within this Face.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is that true?!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. It is clear from his actions towards you. The remnants of his heart... pull him back.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I will break the curse that allows Egil to control the Faces. I need you to buy me some time.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. We'll try! Reyn! We've got to help Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Eh?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Come on!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora? Was that you or...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? As for him...he'll be fine. Don't worry.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt! It's OK... It's all right now... I'm just so happy to have you back.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Egil...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I promise I'll be back for you. Until then...stay safe.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Drink it. You must be thirsty. Don't go dying on us. After we take Egil down, we'll get you looked at. I know a good doctor nearby. She is Machina though. Reyn.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You are Egil, leader of Mechonis. Wait. I didn't come to fight you. I didn't come to surrender to you either. I just want to know something. I've seen the legends of the Machina right here in the capital. I think I understand why you want to fight the Bionis. But why send the Mechon to attack the people of Bionis? I don't see the joke! We share the same world! The Homs, Nopon and High Entia live in harmony, so why not the Machina too? Of course.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A military strategy in which you cut the supply lines and starve out the enemy.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't understand. What?! Yes.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But that means...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What're ya talkin' about?! Are ya sayin' we're just food?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So you attacked Bionis to reduce the Bionis' power supply? Foolish? We only grieve for those we've lost, as you do! Machina or Homs we've suffered the same! Don't tell me it's different! So then... Yes, we can. To get this far... we've fought long and hard.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk... This whole thing stinks, but he's got a point!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Agreed. Egil, leader of Mechonis! The lives of the Machina and the lives of all that lives on Bionis are one and the same. We won't stop. Not until you realise that! You know, Egil. You know the reason. The golden Mechon! Zanza?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I won't let you kill Shulk! Yes... Meyneth, the villagers, everyone loved you. That is why they wished to live alongside you. It's all so clear now. To Meyneth and to me. Please, you have to listen to me! Egil! Egil!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We have to run, get out of here! The whole city's gonna come down!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Run where?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We have to get out of the city! Get as far away as we can!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt! Where are you?! Gadolt!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sharla! What're you doing?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He's gone! He's not here anymore!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's no time! We have to get ourselves out!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No! I have to find him! Gadolt!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Pull yourself together! Remember, Sharla, we've got a job to do! What's gonna happen if the Mechonis starts moving?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's gonna happen to Juju and Otharon?! Gadolt's a Homs soldier! He wouldn't have hung around here to die. He would've got out.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? All right...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right! Now come on! Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I-it's you...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt! What's happening?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's like we're floating in mid-air!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora... Are you doing this? This light... Was it you who saved us when we fell from the fortress? Meyneth? Where's Fiora?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's OK. I'm here too. After all that occurred at the fortress, my soul was exhausted. But I was revived by the cry of a young Homs. By his wish to protect you all.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If he had not acted as a shield, I would have been unable to save you. I am sorry.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gadolt saved us. Now he's...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Mechonis! Where's Egil?! Stop this! Kallian and the others are still on the sword! Our friends are going to die! Stop!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'll kill him! That murdering monster is gonna pay!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Otharon!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry. I can't do it.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That hurts!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Where are we? Alvis. Thank you.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Alvis, what happened to the allied force? That's good.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There is still time.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora? No, you're...?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Mechonis and I exist as one. Egil is using ether energy absorbed from the Bionis to force it to move. There is still time before the Mechonis fully adapts to the ether.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But how are we to get there? The Mechonis capital is destroyed. You have our gratitude. We must go there at once.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then let's get a move on. This one's for Gadolt.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hear, hear.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Too right! Gadolt's wishes live on through me. We will fight to the end.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Understood.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oi! Look at that! What the?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I know.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Vanea? Actually, I'm grateful. Thanks to this body, I got to see Shulk and the others again. Shall I call her? She is usually asleep. Maybe she just doesn't want to disturb me. It's an unusual feeling... Two hearts in one body. It's not every day you get to experience something like this. It's as if I can see into her heart. We each know what the other's thinking. But it's strange. It feels like there's a part of my heart that's hidden. It's the part that holds Meyneth's feelings, and I can't see them. Maybe it's only natural. Everyone has one or two secrets, right? But I know how much she cares about this world. That's why I'm happy to let her use my body. Yeah, I know.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Glad to hear it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's great news.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We won't let 'em down. This is one fight we can't afford to lose.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Heropon Riki all set! Riki bounce some heads!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Really?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're a tough old timer.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's this? The old fossil wants to tag along? As long as you don't slow us down. We're here. Everyone ready?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ready.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Anytime!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Leave it to Heropon Riki!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey, Shulk. What is it this time? Stop worrying and come on.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Monado isn't at full strength. I don't know if it can beat Egil.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You talkin' about that Apocry-whatchamacallit thing? Don't worry! He's no match for all of us together!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? At least the previous encounter allowed us to gauge how he fights. We won't make the same mistakes again!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Now ya tell us! I wish you'd said something earlier. Shulk! Did ya hear that?! Looks like you'll get your wish!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Something's not right.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Egil... He called me Zanza. The same Zanza who devastated Mechonis. What did he mean?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He was just trying to get to you.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I told you before, right? I haven't had any visions lately.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But I still know...if I concentrate... I feel like something will happen, and it does...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are you saying you don't need a vision to know what comes next? Pull the other one.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn, you're going to scratch your head with your right hand.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Huh?!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What are you on about, Shulk? Stop playing around. Ohh... But... How did you do that?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can't work it out. Ever since we came to Mechonis, my abilities have been changing. Why would that happen? If it's true that Zanza used the Monado to lay waste to Mechonis, then is it right for me to use it? Is what I'm trying to do really the right thing?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk... Shulk!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's wrong?!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No! No! It's happening to him too. Shulk! Hold on! You all right?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. It's OK. I'm fine now.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Man...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Your control of the Monado has always been flawless. It never crossed my mind that this would happen to you too. Are you sure you're OK?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Perhaps you are suffering this much because you put all your energy into fighting the effect of the Apocrypha.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ain't you learnt yet, Shulk? How many times do I have to tell ya? If something's up, you've got to spit it out, man! I ain't just talking about visions. I mean whatever's on your mind. All right?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry, Reyn.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't go apologising. It's my fault for not noticing. Let's get one thing straight. I've still got your back.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thanks. No. This wasn't caused by the Apocrypha. It's a completely different kind of power.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's happening to me?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I know I should be glad we made it this far, but if we don't find the Apocrypha Generator soon...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Exactly. The fight against Egil's not going to be easy with the Monado in its current state. And we don't know what kind of toll it'll take on Shulk's body. We have to destroy that generator.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's up ahead.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's a strong energy coming from up ahead. That has to be it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Really?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then this is it! Egil's gonna be scrap metal when I'm through with him!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's just as I thought. The Monado feels the same as it did before the Apocrypha took effect. No, it feels even more powerful. The Bionis' Monado. And this Monado. They have to be connected somehow. Why am I remembering that dream? Why now? Without the power, I can't stop Egil. I have to concentrate. All I have to think about is how to stop the Mechonis. If the Monado does bring about the end, then I know what to do. Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, what were you thinking about?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nothing.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So. It's like that is it?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Really, it's nothing.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Listen, Shulk. If it's too hard for you handle on your own, talk to me!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You can tell any of the others as well. We're all here for you. Don't forget that.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're right. You're here for me.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Of course! And don't overdo it, OK? We all saw what happened. Is your arm OK?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, it's not bad. I'll live.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oi, you two! Is something up?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No, it's nothing. Come on.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk... You can...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wait. It's moving!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You mean...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No, it can't be!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Move out! Don't forget we've still got a job to do!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right! What?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nyapakapow!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Chew on that, Apocawhatever! We did it, Shulk! Shulk? Oi! Whoa!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's happened to the Monado?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It must've changed just as the generator was destroyed. It's amazing.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Now we're talking! Next up - Egil!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Can you go on?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Me? I'm all right. Come on. We have to stop Egil. Egil! Stop the Mechonis! There has to be a way for us to live in peace! There's no reason for us to fight! You must stop this now!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's that?! Egil! You'll regret this!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Egil! Stop this!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Incredible!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Whoa!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Don't do it!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That voice. Who is that? I will. I'll kill him. A thousand times. Yes. I want to. I'll kill him. For Fiora. For the Emperor. For my home!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That is why they wished to live alongside you. It's all so clear now. To Meyneth, and to me!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No! This isn't what I want!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! No!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I've forgotten all about that. I realised that we both share the same pain. Egil, I don't have any reason to kill you. I know. But I won't do it. I can't kill you, but I can stop your blade. And I'll do it. Over and over again, until... we understand each other. OK? I don't understand. Does being controlled by the Monado mean you will eventually become Zanza? What do you mean? I don't know much about any curse. For now, all I can do is this, Egil. We can live in peace again.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson! Why?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oi, old man! Are you completely out of your mind?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who are you?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Zanza's disciple?! Egil, what do you mean?! Dickson, what are you?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Get away from him! No!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Wait, who's this guy?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do you mean?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Zanza grew tired from our battle, and then the High Entia ancestors trapped him. His flesh was sealed away on Prison Island. His soul, and hence the Monado, was confined to Ose Tower.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? In those ruins?! But what does this have to do with Shulk? What are you saying?! You planned all this when you found Shulk? What?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk was already dead?! That's impossible! We grew up together!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But why use Shulk? What was it that made you choose Shulk as your vessel?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So then... Shulk's ability to use the Monado...", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And those visions that he used to save us!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You evil...!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What are you gonna do, Dickson?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Bionis!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Bionis moves!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's... the Monado!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why?! Egil and Shulk had put their differences aside!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Zanza! Reyn, now!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How could you do this?!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I finally understand. The futures of our children belong to them alone. Though we are their creators, their lives are theirs to control. Even if the passage of fate is as you have decided, I will teach you the strength of their will to resist. Zanza. If you choose to deny the existence of every living being but yourself, then I choose to fight. To fight for them! That's right. We won't let you erase everyone's futures! They are living beings! If you cannot understand this, you have no right to call yourself a god!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Zanza! Meyneth!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Zanza disappear.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He's gone. And things ain't looking good for us!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The...the Bionis! That light! What's happening now?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I understand your feelings. Leave it to us. We know what we must do. We will do all we can for the people of Mechonis.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Egil... Go in peace.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Let's go! We're leaving the Mechonis! Reyn! Take care of Shulk!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Got it.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You OK?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Good. It still works. The whole place is going to blow! We must return to Junks via the Central Factory!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Let's go!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dundun, what about Egil?", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He will fight Zanza to the very end. But we have our part of the bargain. Once he's gone, we're the only ones left. Let's move, everyone!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Mechonis!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look starboard! What's that cloud?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's Telethia!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson! That's enough! Why, Dickson?! What made you like this?! Shulk looked up to you, respected you!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson! Don't let Zanza control you! Wake up!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Before we were born?! I'll kill you!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Brother!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Kallian! Dickson! He works for the Bionis! He shot Shulk in the back!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They are...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Telethia!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Brother! Lorithia! Let him go!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Explain yourself!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It can't be. Say it isn't so! Brother? Brother! Brother! Just hold on! I'll find a way to save you! Don't say such things, Brother! Brother! Brother!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Where am I? Oh. So I'm... What was I doing? What was the purpose of my life? No. I've got it wrong. I was never alive. It was Zanza! All along! I... Everything I did was... That voice!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk. Here. Miqol made you a wonderful new weapon. Since you lost your Monado, I mean. It uses the latest Machina technology. Use it when you wake up. Then let's all go on living.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's ironic. We want to escape Zanza but we can't leave his body, the Bionis.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well...this is our home.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I cannot be sure, but I believe not. All those who survived are part Homs like me. If they ever do transform, I will be among them. If that time comes, you know what to do. Everyone is obliged to accept their fate.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No way! There's no way Kallian would leave the fate of the High Entia to you if that was gonna happen!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Precisely. And Melia... If we are to survive, we must fight Zanza and the Telethia. It may not be the case with all of them, but a large number of Telethia were once High Entia - your subjects and your brethren.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I am prepared for that. Even if it means harming my brethren, it is for the protection of the survivors. That is the final wish of my father and brother. I will fight! To free the souls stolen by Zanza.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You are a fighter, Melia. We will need all your strength in the fight ahead.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How's Shulk?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He's going to make it. His wound has closed. I think Meyneth used the last of her power to protect him...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So he's OK.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Linada is tending to him now.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He won't wake up. It's like his consciousness has sunk to the bottom of a cold, dark lake. I keep saying his name but he doesn't respond.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Zanza's gonna pay for this! We're backed into a corner, but we'll give it all we've got. What do you mean by that, Alvis? You've got it backwards, man. Just 'cos he thinks it, doesn't make it so. We decide whether to keep living or not.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I agree. Even though he is our creator, that does not afford him the right to take our lives on a whim.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So you think we should just shut up and die?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You are mistaken if you think we will simply accept such a fate and wait to die.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We'll never stop fighting. Not till the end! It ain't the outcome that's important. It's the will to fight back. Alvis! Whose side are you on?! You scared or something?! Frightened of a few Telethia?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry. I need to go and get some air.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora, are you all right?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Guess I wasn't hiding it well. I didn't want to worry anyone.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It must be difficult living with that body.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm getting more and more used to it. But people still look at me funny. Ah, it's not that bad. It feels pretty comfortable actually. I don't need to worry about food or anything like that.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I see.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This body... The energy from the chest component made it work. It turned out to be a Monado. Such a strange feeling.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A Monado? Was that the Monado that Zanza took from Meyneth?! Will your body cease to function?!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'll be fine for now. There's still some stored energy left.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But then what?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia, if I ever... Please take care of Shulk.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Don't talk like that! How can you ask me such a thing?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm sorry.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's no need to apologise.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're right. Thank you, Melia.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If Shulk awakes, will you tell him?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. He worries too much anyway.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He does worry. It's just like him.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Actually, I'm already dead. I have been since the Mechon attacked.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But I'm happy now. This body has given me the chance to live. Maybe I don't have much time left. But at least I can be with Shulk for a little while longer.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Do you feel that strongly for him?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. That's why I'll fight on, and help him in any way I can. Let's get back. Everyone will start worrying.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. You are right.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And Melia... Can you keep it secret from the others?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You do not want them to worry. I admire your strength.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Maybe I'll tell him. But only when the time is right.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I won't say a word. I'm nothing compared to her.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? A siren?!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! Let's hurry back!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That siren! Is that...?! Let's move!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Gotcha!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm going too!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But Shulk needs you!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I know, but I can't just stay here. What if something happened to you? What would I tell Shulk when he wakes up?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora, are you sure?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Lots of Dinobeast!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look, it's him!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So he survived.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shut up!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You will not mock the memory of my brother!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's my decision. Our destruction was always inevitable. Everything we did was meaningless. That's because... And we're the source of that risk? But why? I couldn't save everyone. Our own path... That was always how it was going to be. If I'd wanted to walk the predetermined path, I wouldn't have come this far. Even with the odds stacked against us, even though I can't see the future, I'll keep walking. My own path. That I decide. Fiora. Reyn. Dunban. Sharla. Melia, Riki. We all feel the same. Alvis. Are you-", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? These things don't give up!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki never lose. Riki protect Colony 6!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right! We can't let them get any further!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You know the drill. Take them down!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh yeah! Get away from him! Forget about the Monado, kid. More space between Zanza and us, the better!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If Reyn's got time to sound off, we must be doing OK!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We are doing OK!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn is correct. Perhaps we relied too much on the Monado and Shulk.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right! We've chosen to fight the Bionis. We have to manage on our own!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This is not the end!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban! Are you OK?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I just overdid it. Fiora!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm OK. I can still fight.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Never!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look out!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Lots of Dinobeasts!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It truly seems as though everything is going as Zanza planned. But our hearts and minds... They still hold the will to seize our own destiny! No matter how hard you try to break us, the future is ours to shape, Dickson! Always!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thank goodness you're here!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That was awesome!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry for worrying you all.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk. Welcome back.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, look out!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! How'd ya do it?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I could see it. The future! I don't have the Monado, but it came to me, Reyn. From within!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Nice one! Looks like we're back in business!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What?! It can't be!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Alvis! Not you too!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No! How can he be one of them?!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Alvis! Is this the only reason you served under my family?! You traitor!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oi! Say something! Shulk!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Leave it. It doesn't matter what he is. That doesn't change anything at all. Does it, Alvis?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Telethia. He's...!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So you're just another one of Zanza's lapdogs!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get ready, everyone.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Show them no mercy.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That all ya got?! Not so tough without your pet, are ya?! I'll show you the will to survive! Get back here!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. You can bet on it. And we will be the best guests you ever had. Dunban, have you seen Fiora?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I have. She said she was going out to get some air. I don't think she went far.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thanks. I'll take a look. Fiora, here you are.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ah, Shulk!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's wrong?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's nothing. It's...so peaceful. It's hard to believe that we defeated a horde of Telethia just minutes ago.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Zanza wants to finish us all. So he can make the vision he's had come true. We're in the calm before the storm.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? They'll be back, won't they? The Telethia... To remove us all from this world...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I won't let that happen. Whatever the future holds, we can never give in. Not to Zanza... No, not even to our destiny.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I wonder why Alvis said what he did.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Which part?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Does this world belong to us, or to Zanza? Why would he side with Zanza? Power? Or maybe he wants to live forever.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who knows... But I don't think his motives are that simple. I'm sure Alvis has some kind of plan. Otherwise, why would he speak to me in my dreams?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He spoke to you in your dreams?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's another reason why I have to find Zanza. I have to find out why.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You and me both. I must fulfill Meyneth's wish! Shulk? You wanted to speak to me about something?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh, that's right. Linada's looking for you. She wants to examine you. She's back at Junks.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh... Hey...umm... Can you go ahead? I'll go and see Linada in a minute. I need a few minutes to myself.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. No problem. Take your time.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thank you. What can I do? If I go to see Linada, she'll find out what's happening to my body. I need to come up with a good excuse. Please... Let me be with Shulk just a little bit longer...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Zanza is inside the Bionis. I just know it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson must be there as well.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. And Alvis too.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's all good, but how do we get to them? If they're inside the Bionis, we're gonna need to dig a pretty big hole.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? How long that take? Riki get old soon!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then that means...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah! Time to knock some heads!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki never lose! For Riki family, Riki win!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We must show this god our unyielding will to survive!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The suffering of my people will not be in vain!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The crimes against our friends will not go unpunished!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ready. We go to the Bionis' chest. We will free our world from Zanza's curse! It's the inside of the Bionis.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looks quite different from when we entered via the marsh.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The Bionis is regaining its biological functions.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Must be 'cos Zanza woke it up.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then we find Zanza, and stop him.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That voice... It's Lorithia! Show yourself!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Quit yer yapping and show yourself!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Lorithia! What are you planning?!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Forget her for now. We must push on to the heart.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? All right.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm still alive. I won't die. Not yet. And that's why we're here.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everyone who lives in this world has a life. So it shouldn't be threatened by anyone. We'll never give in to Zanza.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's...", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Kallian!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Brother! Brother! Brother? Is that really you? I have longed to see you. Brother, I must apologise. To you and to everyone. I am a princess. But I brought misfortune upon the High Entia. I... I... Brother. Yes. I have done nothing. This is your destiny. Accept it with dignity! Brother. Thank you, Brother. Your words will stay with me forever.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? His words?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki heard. Riki heard Melly's brother. Kallian say 'hope of Bird People'. Where Melly's brother? Riki not see him, but Riki hear him.", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki. You, too, heard his parting words. Thank you.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Melia...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Thank you for your concern. I am all right. Let us go and secure the future my brother so hoped for.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We will. Together.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do you mean?! I'm gonna...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Come on, everyone! We've got to get to Prison Island!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hey! Is this?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's Prison Island. So it has sunk into the Bionis' head.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dundun, Riki feel funny feeling from above! Riki instinct say Dickson is there!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes, I agree.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Start praying to Zanza, Dickson! We're coming!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Come down here and say that!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What on Bionis is that?! Stop these games, old man!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everyone, be careful!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Monster want to eat Riki!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This thing is no match for us!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Where are we? What is this place?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It looks like a cathedral. There's an altar over there.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? These have scary faces!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We better take a look.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You see something, Shulk?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This indentation... It looks like something should fit inside it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yep! Riki feel like something here!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's probably a way up to the top.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Could it really be that easy?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's no use thinking about it. Let's search for whatever fits into the gap.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I can sense Dickson. We must be near the top. If we proceed from here, we will be unable to return. Are you ready to go on?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No, I need more time.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I understand. We'll be ready.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes, I'm ready.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Aren't you scared?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I would be lying if I said no. But still, we must go on.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Agreed. We know what we're fighting for.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We decided ages ago!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Oh, sorry. I just got caught up in the moment.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Come on, Dunban.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Right! Let's go! Time to seize our destiny!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dickson! Waiting for us to fight you? We'll never do that. I know. And I must thank you for granting me such power. It's all down to you that I'm standing here ready for you now. Dickson! If you're so determined to stop us, then we will kill you!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Not her power. I've inherited her memories. That's why I fight you!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why are you fighting? You're helping Zanza to create a world where nothing exists. What could you possibly hope to get out of it?! You're wrong! Is that your reason? For fighting? Meyneth wished for a world where the peoples of Bionis and Mechonis could live hand-in-hand. You will never get away with this!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It can't be!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'm fine. I'll carry on fighting beside you until the very end.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Be careful! Melia!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Stand up, Fiora! Did you not say that you wanted to be with Shulk?! Do not throw your life away for this scoundrel!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? She's right! You have to take what you want! There's no point in dying!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Show him what you're made of! Come on, man! You don't need the Monado to take down this piece of scum!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki know! Riki know Shulk brave! Riki want to see the old Shulk! Shulk is real Heropon!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk! Real power comes from within! Believe in your own true strength, Shulk!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everyone...", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk. It's time, Shulk. Let's finish this.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I will not fail. With your faith in me, and our strength combined... We can do this. Face me. Stand and fight! Dickson!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Get back here! You expect us to let you go?! What?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Enough. It's Zanza we're after. Not him.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, his wounds...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Where are we?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What happen?! It night-time! Is Riki have bad dream?!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look down! Look at all the stars!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We're not on Bionis any more. There's no land or sea either.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's beautiful.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is that a ball of water? It's you!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is it, Shulk?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That voice! It's Zanza!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But he looks different.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Meyneth's Monado.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You gonna give him a reward?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Are you so arrogant to believe that the High Entia, no, all life on Bionis, are nothing but your playthings?! Yes. You don't know how it feels to have slain my brethren after they had transformed into Telethia!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So this is the arrogance of a creator. But though you feign omnipotence, the High Entia still confined you to Prison Island! That is how limited you are.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Until I was born.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Meyneth...", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Never! I don't wanna be your vessel or your disciple! I just want to live my life as a Homs. In a world without you! Is that why you laid waste to Mechonis?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? So you're saying us Homs are next in line, eh?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You're wrong! Meyneth chose to exist alongside us! She grew to consider us her friends. You should have accepted that! But what you were hoping for was not friendship. You wanted worthless slaves. Our lives as food! We will not allow it! We cannot! We will stop you! I don't know. It comes from the bottom of my heart. It shows me my enemy. It reveals the future I must change!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? The future we see is not set in stone. There are infinite possibilities based on the paths we choose. You should be well aware of this notion. For that is how you have always existed!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why should we care?! What's important isn't whether you can see the future or not. It's the will to make a choice, and the strength to seize your destiny! Our time has come. Our destiny is our own!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It is not only you that has the right. Every living thing has the freedom to choose the path they walk. And that is the future!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That voice! That is something I decided long ago! Today, we use our power to fell a god, and then seize our destiny! Where am I? Your home? Whose voice was that? And that voice. It's Meyneth! And that was how we were born. Bionis being filled with life, and the Telethia coming to wipe it out. It was all the will of Zanza. His future and our future. It might have been possible for them to coexist. New god?! Alvis, what are you? Alvis? I don't know. All I wanted to do was stop Zanza having his way. That's all. I cannot be a god!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Too right! You're great 'n' all, but there's no way you're a god.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Everyone!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look, don't worry, Shulk. None of us want to be gods anyway. And I don't really know what the future holds. But we just want to live our life as it comes.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Eating grub, sleeping, laughing, crying. Sometimes arguing. Sounds all right!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. He's right. And being with the ones we love. That's enough.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Even so, we change little by little. Every day is a little different from the last. We do not know what the future will hold.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? More fun not knowing! Riki want to have fun!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Life's little surprises are what makes it great. We don't know what's going to happen. It's worrying sometimes, but it's also exciting. Don't you think?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. Isn't that called progress? Aren't we all continuously evolving? I'm not sure we need a more dramatic change than that.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. You're right. Little by little. Each day as it comes. That's how we should live. That's our world. Alvis... It sounds like you don't think I can make my own decisions. I'm supposed to be the god! I won't decide. The future should be decided by each and every person in the world. And so, what I... No, what we wish for is... A world with no gods!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ah, yes. That's excellent. So, you can take the materials to District Four? Thanks to Melia and Vanea. The High Entia and Machina have some amazing technology. Hear, hear. And may it last forever.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Dunban?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora! What is it?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Have you seen Shulk?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He just left. I don't know where he's gone, but he was with Reyn and the others.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? OK. Thank you.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fiora!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's nothing. Good luck!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? If you're looking for Shulk, he is not here.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Amazing. It's like you've got eyes in the back of your head. What were you looking at? The sea?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I wasn't looking at anything in particular. If anything, Fiora, I was thinking. Thinking about the future that awaits us all.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Wow. You're so much more thoughtful than me.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Really? I don't think so. I was just answering your question.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? But I know what you mean. You're right. We've been through a lot.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. We have. I am grateful to all of you. It is because I met you that I experienced so much. And it is the reason I am here now.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. We're happy you're here too. Thanks, Melia. For everything. I'm glad I met you.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And I you.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Almost got it!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Go Reyn! Go Reyn! Riki really hungry!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Go on! Put your back into it, Reyn! Are you OK?!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It's salty! What's up with the water being so salty?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn bad fisherman! Riki want eat big fish!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Give us a break. You try next time, furball!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Fishing is Reyn's job! Riki's job is eating!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hang on a sec. Isn't Oka gonna have a massive go at you if you don't go back to her with 14 fish to feed all your littlepon?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Riki forgot! Wifeypon very angry if not catch more fish!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It ain't me she's gonna be angry with.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn catch fish! Catch fish now! Fish! Fish!", "completion": "Riki"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Here you are! The breeze feels so good.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? It does.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What is it?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That hairstyle. It looks good on you. That's all. Yeah.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Really? I was thinking about growing it out, but... Hey, which do you prefer?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Both, of course.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Come on. What am I supposed to say to that?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Sorry. OK. It's great like that. Don't change it.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I'd forgotten what it feels like to do this. I wonder what the future has in store for us.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Who knows. I'm sure it will be full of ups and downs.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ups and downs?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't know what the future holds. But that means I can imagine the possibilities. We can achieve anything we put our minds to.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah. You're right!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Do you remember what the Monado, I mean Alvis, said to us the last time we saw him?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. Of course.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? One day I hope I can meet them all. The people of this endless world.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Me too. We will. I know it.", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? We'll meet them. And whatever happens, we'll face our future together. Who's this?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Ain't she the one who attacked us in the capital?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Tyrea! What are you doing here?! You're hurt.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Watch it! Oh!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Tyrea. What happened?", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is she dead?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. It looks like she's just passed out.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Let's get her to the infirmary. Reyn!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Come on, why me?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Please.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Is she OK?", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Her injuries aren't severe.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? When the Bionis awoke, the ether flow around the colony became unstable. Maybe that's why she lost consciousness.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. That's not what I meant.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You mean why didn't she become a Telethia?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Precisely.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? For pure-blooded High Entia to become Telethia, the ether energy surrounding the Bionis has to be above a certain level. Luckily, the level of ether energy here is not as high as on the upper regions of Bionis. That may be what kept her safe. Or perhaps...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Perhaps what?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No, it's nothing.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Something about this makes me feel uneasy.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I know what you mean. We'll have to keep an eye on her recovery.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Why does she hate you so much, Melia? You're both High Entia. Is being pure-blooded really that important?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Tyrea's birth mother is most likely my step-mother.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? You don't mean...Yumea?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yes. I heard about it from Kallian after I returned from the tomb. Mother was leader of the Inquisitors, a secretive organisation operating in the shadows of the imperial household. The group plotted to maintain the imperial bloodline through a clandestine ritual - a ritual where Tyrea was conceived.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And she was secretly raised as an Inquisitor assassin.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Hold on a sec. Are you saying that Tyrea is Kallian's half-sister?", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? That's right.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Then isn't she in the same position as you?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Mm-hmm. Tyrea! You're awake! You're wrong! I'm...!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I don't buy that for a second!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Reyn?!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Pride of your people?! How about you're jealous of Melia! Ain't ya? You're envious of her, right? Of how she lives her life. You just want everyone to feel sorry for you for being in the shadows all your life. I'm sayin' that you'll never have a life like Melia's! You don't have the faintest idea why Melia's been fighting. Even if you'd been born in her place, the Emperor still would've chosen her as his successor. Succeeding the imperial line ain't all about blood. It's about takin' on the will to do whatever it takes for your land, for your people, when the time comes. That's what makes Melia different from you!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Both of you, stop this! This is no time for pointless bickering.", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? He's right. We survivors shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves. Right, time's up! I want the room cleared out.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yeah, OK...", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? And you. You need to calm down and get some rest.", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What's going on?!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Look! Over there! The colony!", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Telethia!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Guys! She's gone!", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Tyrea, you mean?!", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Could that Telethia be her?!", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? No. At least, I'm fairly certain.", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's no time now. We must pursue it. It must be Tyrea after all!", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? What do we do?! Do we have to fight her?", "completion": "Fiora"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? There's no time to think about it. Ready yourselves!", "completion": "Dunban"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Shulk, I must...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? I know.", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Tyrea! You're safe? *gasp*", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Yumea?! But why? Didn't she feel betrayed?", "completion": "Shulk"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Her final wish?", "completion": "Sharla"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? This is my responsibility. Father entrusted me with the empire and its people. What I believe in is the will of those struggling to survive. I have to fight if I am to convey this to the next generation. Besides, Yumea is your birth mother. There is no need for you to carry out such an unpleasant task. This is a duty that my father and brother conferred upon me. Tyrea... I believe you and I are alike. Tyrea...", "completion": "Melia"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this? Well, there she goes.", "completion": "Reyn"}, {"prompt": "Who would say this?
