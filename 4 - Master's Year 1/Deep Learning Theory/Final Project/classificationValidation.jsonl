{"prompt":"A Mechon M71! I bet I can use its optical system to align one of the Anti-Air Batteries. No good. It's broken. The joint section. It's buckled. It's completely useless. An M69! Its armour would be perfect for making a shield. If I can just get it off, I should be able to... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I'll lure it away and Topple it! When it's down, use your Arts to finish it off! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"The Monado... I hope I can figure out the secret of its power one day. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Don't worry about it. Let's get back. Here we are. I'd better stop in at HQ. You off to the Weapon Development Lab? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Uh-oh! The colonel's gonna explode. Same old colonel. At this rate, the men will all be dead before they see any action. Dickson! When did you get back to Colony 9? Your research notes really helped. Well, anyone can activate it. The problem is controlling it. Yes. If anyone other than Dunban were able to control the Monado, we could surpass any military force in the world. It's still only conjecture, but it's starting to look like the Monado might be something far more significant than just a weapon for defeating Mechon. It's the symbol that appears in the centre when it's activated. What I know is, the central piece is made from multilayered glass. The symbol appears on the top layer. And each layer is constructed differently. Which means... If we could just unlock the Monado's power... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Dunban! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"That's OK. Shulk has no sense of taste. He'll say it's delicious even if it's stone cold. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"In which case today he would actually mean it. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Maybe. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"OK. Dunban... Thanks. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Oh, Shulk, you say that every day. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"What? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Fiora! Are you OK? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"I'm sure that's all very clever. But! Why were you more worried about a machine than me, Shulk?! ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Who knows? Anyway, no matter how good a sword it is, if that's what happens when you hold it... Looks like Dunban really is the only one who can use it. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"I won't let my brother use it ever again! Not after what it did to him. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Ah, yeah. Old Square-tache has gone and put me on punishment duty. Fancy tagging along? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Whoa, nasty. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, probably. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Nah, she doesn't mean it. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Fiora! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Looks like it. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Nope. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Like the Defence Force hover transports? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"I ain't got a clue. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Just come by yourself from now on. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"I don't know! But it looks like we'll have to destroy them! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"No. I think they were something left by the civilisation that built this vehicle. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"They didn't seem like Mechon to me. But why did they only show up now? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"That sound... In the sky! It's a...! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"This can't be! ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Heads up, Reyn! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"The colonel! The guys! The colonel... The guys... I'm gonna destroy every last one of those damn Mechon! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Great! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Reyn! Looks like you and I will have to cut a path through them. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Looks like it. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Shulk... Reyn... ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Go now, Fiora! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Reyn! ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Huh? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"You were never cut out for this stuff. You go. I'll take care of things here. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Shulk! Where's Fiora?! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Dunban. This time... It's my turn. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Right! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Yes. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"It's massive. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"No! You can't take any more! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"No! Fiora... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Hey. Have you been to see Dunban? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. Even without the Monado, he's the strongest person I know. Uh... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Shulk... ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"It keeps shouting, 'Make them pay!' 'Destroy every single one of them!' And it won't stop getting louder. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"How about checking out Colony 6? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Maybe. It wouldn't surprise me. But why do you say that? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"It's not your fault. Just 'cos the Monado showed you some future, that don't mean you could do anything about it. You did great. You fought them off. I couldn't have done that. You know, I've been thinking about it. Why you can use the Monado, I mean. Dickson told me. You're a survivor from the Monado expedition team that went out 14 years ago. There was a blizzard or something and your mum and dad died. And then Dickson found you and brought you back. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"What? Chosen? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"OK, I'll try. Night, Reyn. I... The True Monado? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Reyn! No! Not that way! Reyn! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Wow! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Great! I love a good climb. Shulk! Look over there. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Smoke... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"OK! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Shulk! Over there! You all right, kid? That can wait. Go! Get outta here! Leave these guys to us. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"OK. It should work now. I fixed the circuit, but it's out of ether. Change the cylinder and it'll be as good as new. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I think it's time for the introductions. I'm Reyn. He's Shulk. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Pleased to meet you. Your camp? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Let's take him up on the offer. I'm surprised there's a Homs camp here, but they might have some information. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I suppose. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"That gear. You must be survivors from the Defence Force! Is Colony 6 OK? Did Gadolt make it?! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Yes. It's good that you managed to evacuate so many. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"We can't lose hope just yet! I'm certain Gadolt and the other soldiers are alive. They're still fighting. I can feel it. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Hmm? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"That thing kills Sharla too. I saw it in the vision. But I can't stop her coming with us. I don't know how I can protect her. But I have to do it. I WILL change the future. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Raguel Bridge? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"What, you think I can't pull my weight in battle? I've got field experience as a medic. If you get hurt, I can use ether to patch you up. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"There's a Mechon... It's taken Juju! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"You said you saw a deep valley, didn't you? ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Let's move. That has to be where Juju is. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Is this the place you were on about? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Its tentacles could come out from under the ground at any second. One false move and you're done for. Wait for my order! Reyn, you got my back? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"'Course! Leave it to me! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"It's up there! Let's go after it! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, weren't it supposed to be that one with the face. I guess we changed more than we expected! Shulk? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"But this one's got a face 'n' all! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Reyn! Better watch your back! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"The sleeping princess awakes. Had us worried there for a minute. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"How long have I been unconscious?! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Hold up! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"We'll find Juju and then smash some metal! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Reyn... ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Yes, it'll be fine. Reyn... Shulk... Thank you. An Ether Rifle? Gadolt! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Some of the people in Colony 9 got eaten... ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"No. It's nothing. Forget it. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"This vision... Was it like before? ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Kind of. I saw an underground ether river. And Otharon... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Reyn, I... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"He's right, Shulk. You two saved Juju once before. I know we can do it again. I believe in you. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Yeah! Juju, Otharon... Just hold on! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Gadolt... The others... I swear I won't stop until I've scrapped each and every one of you! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Shulk! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"That was close! You wanna hurry up? My arm's about ready to drop off. Save the thanks for Shulk and his vision. As soon as I saw an ether river, I knew this had to be the place. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"There's a freight elevator on the next level. From there, it's an easy route out of the mine. As long as it's working... ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"You make me laugh. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Not him again. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Forget about it, kid. We settled the score. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Not just him! A whole bunch! And tons of 'em look like Xord! This one can talk 'n' all! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"I can take the smaller ones. But the rest'll be like fighting Xord over and over! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Focus, Shulk! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"What are you? That light... Everyone! Fall back, now! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Now's our chance! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"We must be outside the tower. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"You've got to be kidding! He's the one who killed Fiora! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Fine. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I don't believe we did anything. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"So, what's your plan from here? Follow that metal-faced machine, I presume? ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Well then. There's only one place he'd go. Galahad Fortress in Sword Valley. A year ago, those things were building a huge fortress, right in the valley. Tactically, it's an excellent location to launch attacks from. I feel there's a strong chance they've now finished building it. That would explain why both colonies were attacked recently. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"So it's settled. Bash down a fortress and smash some metal brains! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"But what could be more important than... Wait... You saw another one. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"I realised something when we were fighting Xord. Wherever we go, they'll follow. We can't run from these things. We must fight on. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I've recovered a great deal since we last met. And that miserly old coot over there made me this. Sharp, light. Perfect for cutting through steel. Show me a Mechon and I'll slice it in two. I might not be in peak condition, but I'm useful. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"We're in it together now. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"You can count on us, Dunban. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I understand. Thank you for everything. No, it's OK. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I want to help Shulk. The Mechon must pay for what they did. And I'm sure Gadolt is still alive somewhere. If he is, I have to find him. Are you sure? ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Thanks for the heads-up, Dickson. The lift don't work! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Looks like it's been broken for a while. We'll have to find another way up. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. But just hold on a minute. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"The Monado was your sword. But...I need it to achieve my goal. So... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Believe in myself? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Who turned up the heat? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"You mean go on in this heat? I'm sweatier than a Brog's armpit! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"I can't say. But walking around in circles isn't going to achieve anything. Our best bet is to look for their village. Over there! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"She hasn't sustained any serious injuries, but her condition is far from stable. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"What can we do? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"No, silly. I'll fire them into the air and the dispersed ether will heal her. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"That's Reyn! I'm over here! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Alvis? Who's that? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"I'm telling you, he was right here. He even taught me how to unlock a new power from the Monado. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Yes. Good quality ones too. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I'm not lying! Alvis... Who are you? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"No! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Are you OK? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Are you the ones who helped me? ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Hey Shulk. You're creeping this lady out. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"This large one is far worse. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"The head of the Bionis? ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"We shall travel to the Nopon village. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"We found her half-dead and all alone. But I don't suppose she'll tell us the reason any time soon. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Wounded by a girl... You don't mean you're going to fight the Telethia? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"When I went to collect the ether crystals, some Telethia attacked me. I managed to destroy them and get away. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"The Telethia escaped from our homeland, and I am tasked with killing it. It cannot remain free. For the sake of my people, and the Nopon, it must be stopped. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Out of pity? ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Why, then? ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"You've got my vote. A lady should not go unaccompanied onto the battlefield. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Excuse me! I am quite capable of dispatching the beast alone! I require no assistance of any kind! Chief Dunga, I... ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Don't be like that. Let's meet him first. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Watch out! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Yes. They're quick as lightning and can read your mind. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"And we're going up against the daddy version. No one blink for a second. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"You want us to get equipment for you? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Big attitude for a furry footrest. \"Dinobeast is big and scary!\" Great. That'll come in handy. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Of course Riki know! Melly! Riki hear you hurt Dinobeast! ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"I did. But only a little. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"When Dinobeast hurt, Riki know it go to place with ether crystals. Friends and Riki go to place with crystals. Then we find Dinobeast! Chief tell Riki! Chief always right! ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"Riki? Why are you the Heropon? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"By instinct?! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Shulk, the Telethia can read your mind. Expect it to know what you will do before you do it. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"I know. I'll aim for its antenna and stop its ability to read my thoughts. With the Monado at our side, it doesn't stand a chance. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"It is much more powerful than its offspring. Do not expect it to fall so easily. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Now, Melia! Finish him! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"There's a dark tower at the head of the Bionis. I saw it in a vision. That's where I must go. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"A dark tower? Then we need not search at all. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"So you've heard of it? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Heard of it? I have seen it. A dark tower at the head of the Bionis. Only one place fits that description. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"So you know it? ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Prison Island. Dickson said the same thing. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Indeed. Melia, have you ever been there? ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"You are so... Forget it. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"First we must travel to the imperial capital. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Melia, isn't that the... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Friends, jump in ball! All go to Eryth! ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"Who would've thought Eryth Sea was right on top of Riki's village. Dive deep enough, you can reach their tree! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Yes. Tell me why you are here. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Basically, it all started when... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Is that...? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"You are looking at Prison Island. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"There is a transporter up ahead. We can use that. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"It's a sight to behold. Those look like anti-Mechon defence systems. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Lady? ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Huh. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Melia, are you...? Melia. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I cannot speak now. But I shall fulfil my promise. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"I'm sure you're right. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Alvis?! What are you doing here? Is Melia OK? We didn't mean to cause her any trouble. You don't mean...? Hold on, Alvis. I need to ask you- ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"If you're after Alvis, he's gone. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"I accept. If I am to lead the High Entia despite my mixed heritage... If I am to succeed the throne, then I accept what must be done. Yes, Your Majesty. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"So that's the High Entia Emperor. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Sorean Antiqua. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"It's her. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Her silver spoon accent was a clue, but royalty? ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Melia... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"How do you mean? ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"What did you see? ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Out with it already! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"I thank you for escorting me. I must prove my worth as the next ruler. And I am no less prepared to sacrifice my life than those that have fallen before me. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"You can't seriously think that? This is your sister! This is Melia! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"It's so cold. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Descendant? Are you the progenitor of Antiqua? But he passed away thousands of years ago. I do not understand. But I do not suspect any falsehood in your words. Joy? What do you mean? Wishes? I still do not understand. Is this...? Revered Ancestor... I... Explain yourself. Only imperials are permitted to enter this place. Mother's subject? I... ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Another defence mechanism! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"No problem. Time to break my record. Anyone would think we're not wanted! Are we ever gonna find her? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"We've got to hurry. There's no time to lose! Melia... Half Homs? Melia! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Why did you come? ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"So they escaped. Shulk. Everyone. I thank you. You saved me. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Riki smiley smiley! Melly all safe! All thanks to Heropon! ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"Why was Melia chosen as the crown princess? Shouldn't Kallian have been the one to ascend? And her foe in the Tomb clearly opposed that decision. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"It's a mystery. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. Not at all. I too must apologise for meddling in your customs. We should not have interfered. Yes. The Mechon devastated our homes, and we lost many loved ones. It is. I do not want to hide our true intentions. Our very existence is at stake. What is it? Yes, it is told to us as children. The two fought and died, killing many creatures in the process. Their remains became our worlds, bringing forth new life on Bionis. That's how we were made. Alvis told me the same thing. But why is this happening now? We used it because we- You're talking about total extinction. Then you'll help us? Your Majesty, we need imperial sanction to enter Prison Island. Will you permit us entry? I saw it in a vision. We will fight a faced Mechon. They must pay for what they did. Is it connected to the awakening of the Bionis? I understand. This is not our homeland. If you decide not to let us go, I will accept your decision. It's OK. Yes? It would be my honour. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"But which one is the real Melia? ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"No, it's not like that. They're one and the same girl. I think. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"So they've got a new crown princess. Three cheers for Melia. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Right, but we're still no closer to that murdering faced Mechon. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Shulk, man. Maybe we can still persuade big wings? Melia's crown princess now, I reckon the Emperor might change his mind. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Maybe. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Reyn. The Emperor's request was clear. Give him time. There's more to this island than we know. Things are at play here that reach beyond our understanding. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Dundun right! Riki and friends visit Melly now! ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"Hey! The adults are talking, pops! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"She might like the distraction. All those stiff ceremonial duties... You decide, Shulk. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Really? It all happened so fast. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Her Highness the First Consort is not my birth mother. Members of the imperial family must take two wives: one Homs, one High Entia. My mother is the Second Consort. I am half Homs, half High Entia. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Melia... ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"I have much to prepare. I will have someone call for you later. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"You're a funny one. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Emperor! It can't be! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"What does the siren mean? *gasp* ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Alvis... You saw something? If he knows, then why? But that doesn't mean... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"We are Homs. Do what you must. But your laws don't concern us. No apologies needed. So, Melia, what's it to be? ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Seals? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Big fish coming! ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"Was it protecting the island? ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Primitive? ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"It doesn't care who or what we are. Its instinct was to defend against anything. But we'll never really know. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"We're losing time here. We still haven't reached the island. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Wait a minute. I've seen this thing somewhere before... ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Then the Emperor must be inside. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"What is it, Shulk? Get a move on. You saw it, right? Us bashing that tin man's head in! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"That can't be true! Our forefathers would have had better reason! ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"It's him! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Father! No, Father. Father! ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Fiora! You're still alive! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Father, no! ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"You'll have plenty of time to think about your empire and your people's hopes. If you need me, I will be at your side. But you are an individual. You are Melia Antiqua. And you can't let them get away with this! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Friends act strange! Are friends sad? Riki sad too because of empty belly. ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"Riki, we already ate. Us Homs don't get upset just because we're hungry. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Is it because of the girl who was operating that Mechon? ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"She didn't even recognise us. She's not the Fiora I remember. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Important?! She's more than important! She's the reason we're out here! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, he does. But Fiora doesn't like him in that way. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Yes? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I'm sorry. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"It's Fiora. That's why you're hesitating. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"You're right, Melia. I've made up my mind. I'm going to get Fiora back! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I don't know what to say. Thank you. It's probably a good idea if I go and tell Kallian myself. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Then this is goodbye. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Ahem... ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Listen. I'll keep an eye on Shulk for you. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"The jury's out on that one. That's a relief. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Regent, I accept your request. I will return victorious with Shulk. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Zanza is not dead. I feel it. Our tragedy unfolds once again. Indeed. I do not doubt that Egil, too, is aware. However, why free the Monado? Zanza must realise it is now a double-edged sword. And what reason could he have for choosing the boy? What is this? I am experiencing feelings for the boy? Vanea. Your swift repairs are appreciated. I wish to see that boy again. To meet with the one who wields the Monado. Is Egil aware of my reawakening? Then there is no need to worry. I shall meet the boy. Besides, the Monado will draw him to me. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Throw hot water on ice! ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, nice one genius! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"This place... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Something up, Shulk? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Get him! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"But you're- ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Mumkhar! I thought it might be, but... You're to blame for all this? You dare ask that of us? Why did you betray us to Mechonis? Why did you kill our friends at the colony? Why?! You piece of...! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"We will not bow to you! ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"What's happening?! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Is that it?! That's the puerile reason you've killed all those innocent people? Ravaged our home! Never. I will strike you down and all that you have become, you wretched fool. The Monado will stop you. And then you will know the shame of all that you have done, traitor! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Shulk. Friend should no split up. No leave friend behind. Riki scared but Riki want go too. ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"You arranged this for us? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Yeah! I was hoping for some new stuff! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"You cheap old man! Yes. They made Mumkhar into one. He was the one who attacked Colony 9. Aren't you surprised? ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"I won't! You take care as well. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Right! We head for the hilt of the sword - Galahad Fortress. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"One year on. Now, at last, we will seize our destiny. Isn't that right, Shulk? ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"You scumbag! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"How can that be?! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"You monsters! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"It's Mumkhar... He's not a Mechon! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Yes. Sometimes needs must! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"No... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"You did see something. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"So Fiora is inside. I can't let that vision come true. I have to save her! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Here's our way in. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"We can't let them find us. Let's move! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Shulk! What's that?! Looks like fun! Riki want to ride! ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"We didn't come here to mess about, furball! Time to bounce on! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Hold on! If we can stop that piston, we might be able to shut down the blast furnace. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Right. Let's search for them. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Nice. Let's get down to the blast furnace. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Shulk, is that? ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Got it! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Look out! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"But how can you... Never! If the Monado really is powerless, then why would you want it for yourself? I'll never give it to you! Never! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Fiora?! Fiora! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Egil... No matter how much you yearn for revenge, I will not permit you to have your way! ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"I can't believe it. My first kiss. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"When it happened, when Colony 9 was attacked by the Mechon... I thought I had died. I felt the Mechon's claw rip through me. I couldn't remember anything. There was no sound, no light, no pain. When I came round, I had the body of a machine. And it felt like there was someone inside me. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Yes. Inside my heart, I was crying out desperately. But you didn't hear me. Nobody did. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Maybe she's sleeping. Or maybe she's trapped like I was. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"I guess. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"I knew she was using my body, but I didn't hate her for it. She was kind. She was taking care of my body. I could feel it. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"No thanks. But I'd like some water. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"You don't have to do that. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"The Fiora you knew is dead. Just think of it like that. It's for the best. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"No. No more regrets. I will protect you. Besides, there's someone else inside your head. We can't leave her there. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I guess not. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Mechon! No! Not now! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Fiora! Right. Come on, Monado. Don't let me down. No! I won't let you take her from me! This time, I will protect Fiora! Yes! The Monado's light! I can do this! The Monado... It worked, but... I feel worse than before. Whatever he did to the Monado is... What's that sound? No! We're surrounded! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Where are the others? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, it got rough but at least you got out safe. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Look at me, I'm useless. Can't even keep a promise. I promised Fiora I'd look after Shulk. Stupid... ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Don't go doubting yourself, even if things get tough. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"I get it. So now what? ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"We go looking for Shulk and Fiora! I might be like a third wheel, but I can still lug around the heavy stuff. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Thanks to you! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Fiora! She remembers us! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. She's been through a lot. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I can see. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, he'll be blubbering at the sight of us. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Hahaha! I don't think he'd ever cry in front of you two. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"When no one's watching? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Yep. He's always been like that. He's a big softy, but he hates anyone seeing it. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"I never knew. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I've been pumping my guns. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"I wanted to, but it feels more like he's the one who's been protecting me. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"That's not true! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"But you are here for something. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Was I that un-dependable before? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Take it as a compliment! ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Right, let's go. You wanna see my brother cry, don't you? ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"We can't have that, can we? We'll rest here before going any further. Melia, do you need to rest? ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"How considerate of you. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Riki know. She wears silver armour. Shulk look everywhere for her. ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"Indeed. Shulk and Fiora... Everyone knows they like each other, but they're just not ready I suppose. They are the perfect match, but if they don't hurry up and tell each other... ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Everyone landed in the same area. They have to be around here somewhere. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"A village in a place like this! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Shulk! ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Guys! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Congratulations. I'm glad she is safe. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"A form of mechanical life born of the Mechonis... Is that correct? ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"For us? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Shulk, I'm... ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Thanks. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"We were told that you were waiting for us. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"I get that, but he can't have lived that long. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"So he wants to do to us what the Bionis did to the Machina? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"What're you talkin' about?! Did you forget what he did to us?! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"I understand about Egil. But why us? You should be aware that Shulk's sword, the Monado, has the power to destroy Mechonis weaponry. It's said that it was once the sword of the Bionis. Doesn't the very sight of it make you quiver? ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"A problem? But where? We'll take a look. The beach at the base of Digit 5, right? I think we found it. Is this the Piezoelectric Unit? Linada, will Fiora be OK now? But! You're right. I'll try and get some rest. Thank you for everything you're doing. Yes? I'll go and see him. He wants Egil stopped, and so do we. But I need to sleep on it. Thank you. Umm... Yes, very well. I wanted to...talk about your son. Yes. We agree with you. Egil must be stopped. But we can't act now. Before we came here, we heard of plans to form an allied force on Bionis. Any day now they're going to launch an attack on Mechonis. But it's too dangerous. Egil has made a weapon that could kill us all. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"You know each other? Why did you keep that to yourself? That information is vital to all who fight Mechonis. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"We won't let Shulk die. Not ever! ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"I have to hand it to her. That Linada's pretty good. And not just with machines. She's also quite familiar with organic physiology. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"And don't forget, it's because of Shulk that we're all here, fighting together. I think that shows he has a strong character. Am I wrong, Dickson? ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Vanea... ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"I will. Thank you. Is that possible?! Thank you, Linada! ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"We're inside the Mechonis. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Egil is at the top... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Whoa, don't look down! Anyone know where we are? Other than high up? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Stop moaning about it. Look. We can make camp over there. Let's rest for a while. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Yep. The sighting's been a bit off lately. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Yeah! I feel great! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Oh, it's nothing. Just my imagination. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Get down! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Another vision? Nice one, Shulk! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"That voice! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"We fight. But don't kill him. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Is that Sharla's boyfriend? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"What's wrong, Gadolt?! Why would you say that?! Speak to me, Gadolt! Gadolt! Stop! Gadolt... ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"No. It's not true. My Gadolt... ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Of course. Initially, the Monado couldn't take a Homs life. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"So this is the Mechonis capital. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"It looks so desolate. Like there are no signs of anyone living here. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Can't believe it used to be so lively. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Wielding the sword of light, the Bionis attempted to destroy the Machina. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Fiora. I see now. It was her inside you. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"What worries me is the Monado that the Bionis used. It's no different from how the legends describe, but still... ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"But how do we get to the shrine from here? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Up ahead is a transporter leading to the shrine. But it's inactive. We need to trigger the Verification Devices to activate it. We'll find one at the top of each of the four pillars. If we trigger them all, we can use the transporter. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Maybe my body itself is the key. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Gadolt... You're just like I was. You can remember who you are. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"I will break the curse that allows Egil to control the Faces. I need you to buy me some time. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Gadolt! Where are you?! Gadolt! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"I-it's you... ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Fiora... Are you doing this? This light... Was it you who saved us when we fell from the fortress? Meyneth? Where's Fiora? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Otharon! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Sorry. I can't do it. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"But how are we to get there? The Mechonis capital is destroyed. You have our gratitude. We must go there at once. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Oi! Look at that! What the?! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"I know. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"That's great news. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"You're a tough old timer. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Ready. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"The Monado isn't at full strength. I don't know if it can beat Egil. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I told you before, right? I haven't had any visions lately. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Are you saying you don't need a vision to know what comes next? Pull the other one. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"I can't work it out. Ever since we came to Mechonis, my abilities have been changing. Why would that happen? If it's true that Zanza used the Monado to lay waste to Mechonis, then is it right for me to use it? Is what I'm trying to do really the right thing? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"No! No! It's happening to him too. Shulk! Hold on! You all right? ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Perhaps you are suffering this much because you put all your energy into fighting the effect of the Apocrypha. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"I know I should be glad we made it this far, but if we don't find the Apocrypha Generator soon... ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Listen, Shulk. If it's too hard for you handle on your own, talk to me! ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Move out! Don't forget we've still got a job to do! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"It must've changed just as the generator was destroyed. It's amazing. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Whoa! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"No! This isn't what I want! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"I've forgotten all about that. I realised that we both share the same pain. Egil, I don't have any reason to kill you. I know. But I won't do it. I can't kill you, but I can stop your blade. And I'll do it. Over and over again, until... we understand each other. OK? I don't understand. Does being controlled by the Monado mean you will eventually become Zanza? What do you mean? I don't know much about any curse. For now, all I can do is this, Egil. We can live in peace again. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Who are you? ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"In those ruins?! But what does this have to do with Shulk? What are you saying?! You planned all this when you found Shulk? What?! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"The Bionis! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"It's... the Monado! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"He's gone. And things ain't looking good for us! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Got it. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"You OK? ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Let's go! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Look starboard! What's that cloud?! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Dickson! Don't let Zanza control you! Wake up! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Before we were born?! I'll kill you! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Brother! Lorithia! Let him go! ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Well...this is our home. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"I cannot be sure, but I believe not. All those who survived are part Homs like me. If they ever do transform, I will be among them. If that time comes, you know what to do. Everyone is obliged to accept their fate. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"No way! There's no way Kallian would leave the fate of the High Entia to you if that was gonna happen! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Precisely. And Melia... If we are to survive, we must fight Zanza and the Telethia. It may not be the case with all of them, but a large number of Telethia were once High Entia - your subjects and your brethren. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"So he's OK. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Sorry. I need to go and get some air. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Do you feel that strongly for him? ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Yes. You are right. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Shut up! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"It's my decision. Our destruction was always inevitable. Everything we did was meaningless. That's because... And we're the source of that risk? But why? I couldn't save everyone. Our own path... That was always how it was going to be. If I'd wanted to walk the predetermined path, I wouldn't have come this far. Even with the odds stacked against us, even though I can't see the future, I'll keep walking. My own path. That I decide. Fiora. Reyn. Dunban. Sharla. Melia, Riki. We all feel the same. Alvis. Are you- ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Oh yeah! Get away from him! Forget about the Monado, kid. More space between Zanza and us, the better! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Right! We've chosen to fight the Bionis. We have to manage on our own! ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Dunban! ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Dunban! Are you OK? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"That was awesome! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Fiora. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Oi! Say something! Shulk! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"That all ya got?! Not so tough without your pet, are ya?! I'll show you the will to survive! Get back here! ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. You can bet on it. And we will be the best guests you ever had. Dunban, have you seen Fiora? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Thanks. I'll take a look. Fiora, here you are. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Zanza wants to finish us all. So he can make the vision he's had come true. We're in the calm before the storm. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"They'll be back, won't they? The Telethia... To remove us all from this world... ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"I wonder why Alvis said what he did. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Zanza is inside the Bionis. I just know it. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"That's all good, but how do we get to them? If they're inside the Bionis, we're gonna need to dig a pretty big hole. ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"The crimes against our friends will not go unpunished! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"The Bionis is regaining its biological functions. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Everyone who lives in this world has a life. So it shouldn't be threatened by anyone. We'll never give in to Zanza. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Riki heard. Riki heard Melly's brother. Kallian say 'hope of Bird People'. Where Melly's brother? Riki not see him, but Riki hear him. ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"Melia... ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Come on, everyone! We've got to get to Prison Island! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Come down here and say that! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"You see something, Shulk? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Yep! Riki feel like something here! ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"Yes, I'm ready. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Aren't you scared? ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"I would be lying if I said no. But still, we must go on. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Agreed. We know what we're fighting for. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Oh, sorry. I just got caught up in the moment. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Dickson! Waiting for us to fight you? We'll never do that. I know. And I must thank you for granting me such power. It's all down to you that I'm standing here ready for you now. Dickson! If you're so determined to stop us, then we will kill you! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Shulk! Real power comes from within! Believe in your own true strength, Shulk! ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"Everyone... ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Shulk, his wounds... ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"What happen?! It night-time! Is Riki have bad dream?! ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"Look down! Look at all the stars! ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"You gonna give him a reward? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"So this is the arrogance of a creator. But though you feign omnipotence, the High Entia still confined you to Prison Island! That is how limited you are. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"You're wrong! Meyneth chose to exist alongside us! She grew to consider us her friends. You should have accepted that! But what you were hoping for was not friendship. You wanted worthless slaves. Our lives as food! We will not allow it! We cannot! We will stop you! I don't know. It comes from the bottom of my heart. It shows me my enemy. It reveals the future I must change! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"That voice! That is something I decided long ago! Today, we use our power to fell a god, and then seize our destiny! Where am I? Your home? Whose voice was that? And that voice. It's Meyneth! And that was how we were born. Bionis being filled with life, and the Telethia coming to wipe it out. It was all the will of Zanza. His future and our future. It might have been possible for them to coexist. New god?! Alvis, what are you? Alvis? I don't know. All I wanted to do was stop Zanza having his way. That's all. I cannot be a god! ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Look, don't worry, Shulk. None of us want to be gods anyway. And I don't really know what the future holds. But we just want to live our life as it comes. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Life's little surprises are what makes it great. We don't know what's going to happen. It's worrying sometimes, but it's also exciting. Don't you think? ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Have you seen Shulk? ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"He just left. I don't know where he's gone, but he was with Reyn and the others. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"OK. Thank you. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"If you're looking for Shulk, he is not here. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Yes. We have. I am grateful to all of you. It is because I met you that I experienced so much. And it is the reason I am here now. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Go on! Put your back into it, Reyn! Are you OK?! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Fishing is Reyn's job! Riki's job is eating! ->","completion":" Riki"}
{"prompt":"I'd forgotten what it feels like to do this. I wonder what the future has in store for us. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Ups and downs? ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. You're right! ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Yes. Of course. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"One day I hope I can meet them all. The people of this endless world. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Me too. We will. I know it. ->","completion":" Fiora"}
{"prompt":"Ain't she the one who attacked us in the capital? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Let's get her to the infirmary. Reyn! ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Come on, why me? ->","completion":" Reyn"}
{"prompt":"Her injuries aren't severe. ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"You mean why didn't she become a Telethia? ->","completion":" Sharla"}
{"prompt":"Perhaps what? ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Something about this makes me feel uneasy. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"And she was secretly raised as an Inquisitor assassin. ->","completion":" Shulk"}
{"prompt":"Both of you, stop this! This is no time for pointless bickering. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"No. At least, I'm fairly certain. ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"There's no time now. We must pursue it. It must be Tyrea after all! ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"Shulk, I must... ->","completion":" Melia"}
{"prompt":"She'll be all right. We and Tyrea share the same goal. Our paths are sure to meet again. ->","completion":" Dunban"}
{"prompt":"What?! But the wings on her head... ->","completion":" Reyn"}
