This task utilizes GPT-3 and Python to create human-like text that mimics the seven main characters from the video games Xenoblade Chronicles: Shulk, Reyn, Fiora, Dunban, Sharla, Riki, and Melia. My implementation for this task consists of the following sections:\n",

        "Section 2 serves as a point of comparison to the final implementation in Section 3 as they use the same training set but use different GPT-3 models. The Babbage model is 1/5 the price of the Curie model, so it should create lesser quality results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Section 3 serves as the final implementation as the task because it is the most powerful fine-trained model that I created. The Curie model used in this section was a good compromise between price and performance because it is the most powerful model that I could fine tune without costing a significant amount.\n",

        "Section 4 was created as a way to test how well GPT-3 could accomplish the task in the opposite direction. However, the results file generated for this model was not very useful for validating it. The training data for this model consists of the same prompt-completion pairs as the models in sections 2 and 3, but the pairs and completions are inversed.\n",

When you play the game, you know you have\\r\\nreached a new chapter each time you receive a save prompt between scenes. \\r\\nThese \"System Saves\" are chapter breaks, and this is how the script below will \\r\\nbe broken up.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be obvious that this guide will contain FULL SPOILERS for the story \\r\\nof the game, as it will be revealing every line of dialogue and describing \\r\\nevery bit of action. That said, I have taken care not to reveal anything - \\r\\nnames, locations, objects, events, etc. - before the player is supposed to know\\r\\nwho/what they are in the story. So if you have not completed the game, you \\r\\nshould be safe reading this script up to the point where you are in the story. \\r\\nBeyond that point, however, you will be spoiled. So be warned!\\r\\n\\r\\nBy way of disclaimer, let me address quote attributions. In dialogue scenes, \\r\\nall lines are attributed in-game to the character speaking. This is not true in\\r\\nthe movie scenes, which show the lines but not the speaker. In most cases, it\\'s\\r\\nobvious who is speaking, but there were a few places where I had to guess. As \\r\\nsuch, do not take the quote attributions in this guide as authoritative! If I \\r\\nhave misattributed any quotes, please let me know. Also, the abbreviations \\r\\n\"V.O.\" and \"O.C.\" refer to voiceover and off-camera (i.e., outside of the \\r\\ncamera shot), respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor any questions, or if there are any errors, omissions, inconsistencies, or\\r\\nother issues, please email me at therewster1106@gmail.com; be sure to include\\r\\n\"Xenoblade Script\" or something similar in the subject line so I know it\\'s not\\r\\nspam. And if I have made even the tiniest of errors (not just mistaken quote \\r\\nattributions - it can be anything), I want to know so I can fix them. It \\r\\nshould be noted that where the script has any grammatical errors (and there are\\r\\na few), I have retained them. And in places where a line the voice actor says \\r\\ndiffers from the word(s) on the screen, I have gone with the written words. \\r\\nAlso, in my depictions of the events, I have endeavored to retain the \\r\\nBritish style that is normative in the game\\'s text.\\r\\n\\r\\nVERSION HISTORY\\r\\n---------------\\r\\n\\r\\nVersion 1.00 - Finished!\\r\\n               October 11, 2014\\r\\nVersion 1.01 - Fixed a couple formatting quirks, typos and a few bits of \\r\\n               wording in some event descriptions for clarity.\\r\\n               October 14, 2014\\r\\nVersion 1.10 - Did a massive revision, focusing mostly on smoothing out the \\r\\n               transitions between scenes.

[V.O.]\\r\\nLong ago,\\r\\nthe world was nothing more than an endless sea\\r\\ncloaked in a boundless sky,\\r\\nreaching as far as could possibly be imagined.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The titans begin to fight each other with massive swords. One uses a sword of \\r\\nearth and metal, while the other wields a blade of brilliant blue light.]\\r\\n\\r\\n??? [V.O.]\\r\\nThen two great titans came into existence.\\r\\nThe Bionis and the Mechonis.\\r\\n\\r\\n[With its blade of light, the Bionis cuts off the arm of the Mechonis, which \\r\\nfalls into the sea below. The Mechonis now wielding its sword with one hand, \\r\\nthe two continue their duel.]\\r\\n\\r\\n??? [V.O.]\\r\\nThe titans were locked in a timeless battle.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Mechonis strikes the Bionis in its side as the blade of the Bionis digs\\r\\ninto the Mechonis.]\\r\\n\\r\\n??? [V.O.]\\r\\nUntil at last...\\r\\nOnly their lifeless corpses remained.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The screen stretches as the screen fades to white, then to black.]\\r\\n\\r\\n??? [V.O.]\\r\\nEons have passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Brief flashes of light can be seen, glimpses of a battle which is raging \\r\\nthrough the haze.]\\r\\n\\r\\n??? [V.O.]\\r\\nNow our world,\\r\\nthis vast land stretching across\\r\\nthe remains of the Bionis,\\r\\nis under attack from a relentless\\r\\nforce known as the Mechon.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Soldiers are shown fighting a hard battle against their mechanical foes, the \\r\\nMechon, on a desolate field. These Mechon forces begin to overwhelm the people \\r\\nof Bionis.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDefence Force Soldier\\r\\nRetreat! Retreat!\\r\\n\\r\\n[A mobile artillery blows up some Mechon, but the machines keep advancing and\\r\\nattacking fallen soldiers.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDefence Force Soldier\\r\\nGet away from me!\\r\\n\\r\\n[As the Mechon advance, one soldier is using his mobile artillery\\'s radio.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDefence Force Soldier\\r\\nNumber of M78 Mechon is unknown!\\r\\n\\r\\n[This soldier is quickly taken by a Mechon\\'s pincers and tossed to the Mechon\\r\\nbehind it. As soldiers continue to retreat, one hero, Dunban, dashes in the \\r\\nopposite direction, towards the battle, and slices through Mechon with ease \\r\\nwielding a blade of intense blue light, much like the sword of the Bionis.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nThey\\'re advancing down our weak right flank.\\r\\nFor a bunch of soulless machines,\\r\\nthey seem to know a thing or two.\\r\\nBut we\\'ll see.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban activates his sword again as two of his comrades-in-arms, Dickson and \\r\\nMumkhar, run to his side. The group has a hiding place behind an overturned \\r\\nvehicle as the battle rages around them.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nDunban!\\r\\nWe\\'ve been given the order to retreat.\\r\\nWe\\'re pulling back the line to Colony 6.\\r\\nThat\\'s where we\\'ll set up the last line of defence!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYeah. That\\'s a good idea.\\r\\nAny more time spent hanging around here\\r\\nand we\\'re done for.\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nCount me in! We\\'ve gotta get outta here.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nOr we can stay and fight?\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nWhat?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[An explosion rocks the place where the three are holing up.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWe may die if we take a stand here.\\r\\nBut staying gives us the chance\\r\\nto change our destinies.\\r\\nWe have the Monado.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban takes up his sword, the Monado.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWith this, the future is ours for the taking!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban leaps up to re-engage the Mechon, but Dickson pulls him back down.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nStupid beast!\\r\\nYour body can\\'t take any more of the Monado.\\r\\nI can tell by just looking at you!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nGetting short sighted in your old age, Dickson?\\r\\nI\\'m fine. Don\\'t worry,\\r\\nI\\'m still in control.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nI should\\'ve known I couldn\\'t talk sense into a beast.\\r\\nLet\\'s do this. I\\'m going with you!\\r\\nYou\\'ll need someone to drag your corpse home.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAs long as you think you\\'ve still got\\r\\nthe strength in you, old man.\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nOi, you two! We\\'ve been ordered\\r\\nto pull back! I\\'m leaving!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWell I say you\\'re coming with us!\\r\\nWhat would we do without those?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban looks at the Steel Claws with which Mumkhar is equipped, as the latter\\r\\nmakes a noise of disgust.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDefence Force Soldier\\r\\nThe enemy\\'s second wave is approaching!\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nIt\\'s now or never, Dunban.\\r\\nLet\\'s show them what we\\'ve got.\\r\\nWe\\'ll give them a warm Homs welcome!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAcknowledged!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban and Dickson leap into battle, leaving Mumkhar by himself.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nWhat\\'re they trying to prove?!\\r\\nI\\'m not throwing my life away! No point\\r\\ndying in some godforsaken field.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mumkhar rises nevertheless.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nNothing for it.\\r\\nI\\'ll have to use Dunban as a decoy.\\r\\nThat should give me time to escape.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Together the three fight off one horde of Mechon, only to see another legion \\r\\nof them approaching.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nYou\\'ve got to be kidding!\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nIt\\'s their main force.\\r\\nLooks like the Mechon are\\r\\nhell-bent on taking us out.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nThey\\'ll have to be if they want to beat us.\\r\\nNow, let\\'s even the odds a bit!\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson [to Mumkhar]\\r\\nYou heard him.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mumkhar looks around in despair as Dunban activates the Monado.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nDickson, Mumkhar.\\r\\nLet\\'s do this!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban uses the Monado to Enchant his two comrades with a glowing purple light\\r\\nas the three tear through more Mechon. Finally, Dickson sees Dunban atop a pile\\r\\nof destroyed Mechon, crying out painfully as he\\'s overwhelmed by the Monado, \\r\\nwhich eventually deactivates as Dunban collapses off the pile. A lone Mechon \\r\\napproaches the fallen warrior.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nDunban!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dickson throws himself on Dunban, taking the hit meant for the latter, then \\r\\nfights off the Mechon and throws it down off the pile.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nI ain\\'t going down that easily!\\r\\nDunban! You all right?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban sits clasping the Monado in apparent exhaustion.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWhat does it look like?\\r\\nI\\'m still good to go!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Elsewhere on the field, out of earshot, Mumkhar rises, laughing.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nGuess even a hero\\'s gotta\\r\\nreach his limit eventually.\\r\\n\\r\\n[As Dickson helps Dunban to safety, the latter notices Mumkhar fleeing.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nMumkhar?! What are you\\r\\ndoing?! That way is-\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nSorry, brothers!\\r\\nHate to drop this on you, but\\r\\nit\\'s the Monado they\\'re after.\\r\\nSo have fun keeping \\'em occupied for me!\\r\\nI\\'m getting the hell outta here!\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nMumkhar, you dirty...\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nDon\\'t worry. I\\'ll organise your funerals!\\r\\nWell, see ya boys!\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nWait!\\r\\n\\r\\n[As Mumkhar runs off, an explosion sends Dickson and Dunban crashing to the\\r\\nground. In the aftermath, a massive Mechon fortress unit approaches.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nIf this is a joke, it ain\\'t funny.\\r\\nLooks like this is it.\\r\\nAt least we know our luck can\\'t\\r\\nget any worse from here.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban gets to his feet.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nDunban?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nDickson, take care of the survivors.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban activates the Monado.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nDunban, what are you playing at?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Meanwhile, Mumkhar is running away to a separate part of the battlefield.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nThose idiots.\\r\\nI\\'ll just come and get the Monado when\\r\\neverything\\'s quietened down a bit.\\r\\nThat thing\\'s gonna be mine!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mumkhar suddenly slips down the incline and takes a fall. At the bottom, red\\r\\nlaser lights appear all over his body as unseen Mechon target him.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nOh no! Please!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mumkhar cries out in despair as elsewhere Dunban is shown holding the Monado.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nVile Mechon!\\r\\nIf you think the Homs,\\r\\nthe people of Bionis,\\r\\nare just waiting here for you to pick us off...\\r\\nYou are sorely mistaken!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban rushes at the Mechon force as the view zooms out from him to the \\r\\nbattlefield, to Sword Valley as a whole, to different regions of Bionis, and \\r\\nfinally all the way out to the two titans locked in eternal combat upon which\\r\\nthis whole world is based.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Title card: Xenoblade Chronicles]\\r\\n\\r\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nCHAPTER 1\\r\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n- One Year Later -\\r\\n\\r\\n[A young man, Shulk, rummages through Mechon wreckage in a grassy canyon.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nA Mechon M71!\\r\\nI bet I can use its optical system\\r\\nto align one of the Anti-Air Batteries.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk discards the part.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNo good. It\\'s broken.\\r\\n\\r\\n[He picks up a different part.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThe joint section.\\r\\nIt\\'s buckled.\\r\\n\\r\\n[He tosses away this part too.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s completely useless.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk then falls back to relax on the ground. But another Mechon piece catches\\r\\nhis attention.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nAn M69!\\r\\n\\r\\n[He runs up to it.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIts armour would be perfect for making a shield.\\r\\nIf I can just get it off, I should be able to...\\r\\n\\r\\n[But the Mechon shell starts moving of its own accord, knocking Shulk back.\\r\\nJust then, someone else, Reyn, runs in.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn knocks the moving Mechon piece away with his shield.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn!\\r\\nIt\\'s not a Mechon!\\r\\nIt\\'s just a Krabble!\\r\\nIt was using the Mechon armour as a shell!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI\\'ll lure it away and Topple it!\\r\\nWhen it\\'s down, use your Arts to finish it off!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Together, the pair take down both the Colony Krabble and a Common Caterpile\\r\\nthat emerges afterwards.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThanks, Reyn. That was a close one.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nMan, what were you doing wandering off by yourself?\\r\\nStay where I can keep an eye on you.\\r\\nIt\\'s pretty dangerous outside of the colony.\\r\\nThere are all kinds of monsters.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\nBut thanks to you, we got its shell. Everyone\\r\\nin the colony\\'s gonna be really happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI\\'m more worried about you than the shell.\\r\\nAh...whatever.\\r\\nKnowing what you\\'re like, at least you\\'ll\\r\\nmake a decent weapon out of it.\\r\\nThis Scrap Driver\\'s excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI just learned by watching\\r\\nDickson make weapons.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\n\\'Course, Dunban\\'s weapon still beats them all.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThe Monado...\\r\\nI hope I can figure out the secret\\r\\nof its power one day.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou will, Shulk. Anyway, we\\'d\\r\\nbetter get back to the colony.\\r\\nIf I\\'m late for drills again, old Square-tache\\r\\nis gonna kill me.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSquare-tache?\\r\\nOh, the Defence Force Colonel.\\r\\nHe\\'s pretty scary.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nTell me about it...\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSorry, I didn\\'t mean for you to come all\\r\\nthe way out here during your break.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nDon\\'t worry about it.\\r\\nLet\\'s get back.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk accompanies Reyn back to the colony proper.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Bionis area intro: Colony 9]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Reyn arrive at the Main Entrance to the Commercial District in \\r\\nColony 9.

The colonel\\'s gonna explode.\\r\\n\\r\\nVangarre\\r\\nCrashing the mobile artillery into a house?!\\r\\nHow long have you been in the force?!\\r\\n\\r\\nDefence Force Soldier\\r\\nSorry, Sir. It\\'s just that we were trying to\\r\\ngo as fast as we could, like you ordered...\\r\\n\\r\\nDefence Force Soldier\\r\\nBut it\\'s impossible to get back to the\\r\\nMilitary District in only 40 seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nVangarre\\r\\nI don\\'t want any excuses!\\r\\nChampions don\\'t whine, they win!\\r\\n\\r\\nDefence Force Soldier\\r\\nYes, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nVangarre\\r\\nYou\\'re a disgrace to the uniform!\\r\\nAre you forgetting the shame you brought on this\\r\\nforce during joint manoeuvres with Colony 6?!\\r\\nStick your back into it, maggots! Move it!\\r\\n\\r\\nDefence Force Soldier\\r\\nYes, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nVangarre\\r\\nGet the artillery back to the Military District, double time!\\r\\nThen I want a million press-ups from both of you!\\r\\nAnd you better not stop until your biceps explode!\\r\\n\\r\\nDefence Force Soldier\\r\\nColonel. We can\\'t move the artillery.\\r\\n\\r\\nVangarre\\r\\nWhat? You\\'d better give a damn good reason why!\\r\\n\\r\\nDefence Force Soldier\\r\\nSir!\\r\\nThe impact of the crash damaged the ether conduction cable!\\r\\nThe ether fuel proceeded to leak out\\r\\nand now the cylinder is empty!\\r\\n\\r\\nVangarre\\r\\nWell, change the cylinder then!

How are you?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDickson!\\r\\nWhen did you get back to Colony 9?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nJust now.\\r\\nI see you\\'ve been busy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dickson holds up a stack of papers.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nLooks like your Monado research\\r\\nhas been going well.\\r\\nI made the right choice leaving you in charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dickson gets off the desk and walks over to Shulk and the Monado.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYour research notes really helped.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nSo you can activate it now then?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWell,\\r\\nanyone can activate it.\\r\\nThe problem is controlling it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nYeah. For everyone except him.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYes.\\r\\nIf anyone other than Dunban\\r\\nwere able to control the Monado,\\r\\nwe could surpass any military force in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nYou think so?\\r\\nWhat are these hidden functions you mention?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s still only conjecture,\\r\\nbut it\\'s starting to look like the Monado\\r\\nmight be something far more significant\\r\\nthan just a weapon for defeating Mechon.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nI see.\\r\\nAnd the evidence to support your theory?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s the symbol that appears in the\\r\\ncentre when it\\'s activated.\\r\\nWhat I know is, the central piece is\\r\\nmade from multilayered glass.\\r\\nThe symbol appears on the top layer.\\r\\nAnd each layer is constructed differently.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nSo it\\'s possible that other symbols\\r\\ncould appear on different layers?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhich means...\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nThe Monado might conceal even more power.\\r\\nAm I right?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk nods in agreement.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIf we could just\\r\\nunlock the Monado\\'s power...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Flashback to Dunban being carried into Colony 9 on a stretcher after the \\r\\nBattle of Sword Valley, with his little sister, Fiora, and Shulk at his side. \\r\\nBehind them, Colonel Vangarre comes into view, bellowing orders.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nDunban!

The screen flashes to white.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban [V.O.]\\r\\nIt was the Monado.\\r\\nIt was...controlling me...\\r\\nEven so...

You\\'re spending too much time in the lab.\\r\\nEither that or rummaging for junk in the scrap yard.\\r\\nIt ain\\'t healthy for a kid your age.\\r\\nThat\\'s why you\\'re always looking so pasty.\\r\\nYou should get out, get some fresh air once in a while.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dickson turns to go.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nAll right, I\\'m off.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dickson departs with a wave and a chuckle. Shulk relunctantly leaves too, as\\r\\nthe view closes in on the Monado.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Within his house on the edge of the Commercial District, Dunban is in bed \\r\\nnursing his injured arm when his sister\\'s voice jolts him out of his reverie.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nDunban, are you awake yet?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora enters carrying a tray of food.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nIs it time to eat already?\\r\\nYou didn\\'t have to bring it yourself.\\r\\nYou could have just called me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nDon\\'t be silly!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora sets the tray down on Dunban\\'s bedside table.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nDo you want me to feed you?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban chuckles dismissively as Fiora sits down next to his bed.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nDon\\'t treat me like an invalid.\\r\\nI\\'m better than I was a year ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nMuch better.\\r\\nI really thought I lost you back then...\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYes.\\r\\nBut now I\\'m almost well enough\\r\\nto handle the Monado again.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora suddenly gets to her feet.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nDunban, don\\'t say that!\\r\\nThe Mechon have gone now!\\r\\nWhy would you say that?!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI just mean I\\'m prepared.\\r\\nSorry.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nOK.\\r\\nMore importantly, eat up before it gets cold.\\r\\nI made something really special today.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nDon\\'t feel like you need\\r\\nto stay here then, Fiora.\\r\\nGo and make your next delivery.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora makes a questioning noise.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWell, I\\'m sure you\\'d like Shulk\\r\\nto try some while it\\'s still hot?\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nThat\\'s OK.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora sits back down on the floor.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nShulk has no sense of taste.\\r\\nHe\\'ll say it\\'s delicious even if it\\'s stone cold.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban laughs.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nIn which case today he would actually mean it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nMaybe.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI\\'m fine, Fiora.\\r\\nOff you go.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nOK.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora gets to her feet again and turns to Dunban as she begins to leave.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nDunban...\\r\\nThanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n[She sets off down the stairs.

Is it another Monado thing?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWho knows?\\r\\nAnyway, no matter how good a sword it is,\\r\\nif that\\'s what happens when you hold it...\\r\\nLooks like Dunban really is the only one who can use it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nI won\\'t let my brother use it ever again!\\r\\nNot after what it did to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nOh, sorry... I didn\\'t mean it like that...\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nAnyway, the point is, I\\'m fine.\\r\\nTo be honest, this has happened a few times before.\\r\\nI\\'ve been researching the Monado for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nShulk! Don\\'t act as if this is nothing!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nLook, don\\'t worry about it.\\r\\nAnyway, Reyn, what did you want to ask me about?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nAh, yeah.\\r\\nOld Square-tache has gone and put me on\\r\\npunishment duty.

And now I have to go all the way\\r\\nto the Mag Mell Ruins and back.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSo you have to go and collect the Ether Cylinders?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThat\\'s the one!

Knew you would!\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nHold on.\\r\\nThe Mag Mell Ruins are in Tephra Cave, right?\\r\\nI heard that there\\'s a Mell Lizard nest there.\\r\\nI couldn\\'t take it if anything happened to Shulk.\\r\\nHe\\'s delicate - not like you, Reyn.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat are you on about?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI\\'ll be fine.

As the two struggle, another pair of Mechon enter a \\r\\nhover transport, which Metal Face then picks up with one clawed hand and, after\\r\\nthe two Mechon have emerged, tosses deep into the Military District, causing a \\r\\nmassive explosion. Metal Face then takes off to another part of the colony.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[In the aftermath, Shulk\\'s party arrive at the entrance to the lab and find a \\r\\nlarge pile of debris blocking their way as they react to the carnage they\\'ve \\r\\njust witnessed.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThe colonel... The guys... I\\'m gonna destroy\\r\\nevery last one of those damn Mechon!\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nShulk! The entrance!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nNo! We\\'ll never get in there now...\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWait... Let me think here...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk thinks for a moment, and then...]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn, Fiora! There\\'s still the mobile artillery!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nRight! If we recharge it with those Ether Cylinders\\r\\nwe collected, we can blast our way in!\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nIt\\'s in the Residential District!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nGreat!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nAll right! This is it! Time to avenge\\r\\nthe colonel and the boys!\\r\\n\\r\\n[As the three run out of the Military District, they are intercepted by a \\r\\ngroup of Mechon at the Central Plaza.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat the?\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\nMore from behind!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The three are now surrounded. They draw their weapons.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn!\\r\\nLooks like you and I will have\\r\\nto cut a path through them.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nLooks like it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFiora!\\r\\nReyn and I will open up a path.\\r\\nThen you can run through.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nYou two can\\'t do this by yourselves!\\r\\nI wanna fight as well!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nGet through!\\r\\nWe\\'ll be right behind you!\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nBut Shulk...\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nA year ago,\\r\\nDunban and the Defence Force\\r\\nfought hard to protect the colony\\r\\nand all of us Homs.\\r\\nNow it\\'s our turn to repay them!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nPlease, Fiora.\\r\\n\\r\\n[One Mechon begins to attack, but Shulk and Reyn fight it off.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nShulk...\\r\\nReyn...\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nDon\\'t look so worried.\\r\\nWe\\'ll just get rid of these ones.\\r\\nShulk won\\'t get a scratch!\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nOK. I believe you.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nGo now, Fiora!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora begins to run off.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nReyn!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHuh?\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nYou take care too!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nOf course!\\r\\n\\r\\n[She takes off down the street.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nLooks like she trusts me\\r\\nafter all!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI told you.\\r\\n\\r\\n[After taking down some more Mechon, Shulk and Reyn are back to back.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThat was a close one.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou were never cut out for this stuff.\\r\\nYou go.\\r\\nI\\'ll take care of things here.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou\\'re too out of breath\\r\\nto persuade me.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nTell me about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The top part of the pillar at the Central Plaza, damaged from the Mechon \\r\\nassault, falls down to where Shulk and Reyn are, forcing the two to split up\\r\\nand get out of the way. Shulk recovers to find Reyn under attack by Mechon.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn, behind you!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Mechon attacks, and Reyn is barely able to stop its pincers. Shulk runs up\\r\\nto help.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nGet outta here, Shulk!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk whacks futilely against the Mechon\\'s outer shell.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDon\\'t be stupid!\\r\\n\\r\\n[More Mechon start to arrive.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nHold on!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Just then, the two hear someone else coming, and Dunban rushes in with the  \\r\\nMonado, slashing at Mechon as he comes, and sending the Mechon attacking Reyn\\r\\nhurtling through the air. His entrance is followed by a string of explosions\\r\\nrippling through all the Mechon at the plaza that he has just slashed.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThe Monado!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban is breathing hard but still standing. He turns to the other two.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nSorry I kept you waiting.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDunban!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhoa yeah!\\r\\nThe Monado!\\r\\nSo this is why you weren\\'t\\r\\nat home. I thought so!\\r\\nThis is what I was waiting to see!\\r\\n\\r\\n[More Mechon approach the three friends.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nReady, lads?\\r\\n\\r\\n[With Dunban\\'s help, the group proceed to destroy the Mechon.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nNice one, Dunban! You didn\\'t waste\\r\\nany time on them Mechon!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nShulk! Where\\'s Fiora?!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThe Residential District...\\r\\nWe said we\\'d meet her there.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn turns towards the fallen pillar now blocking the bridge to the \\r\\nResidential District.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nLooks like we\\'ll have to\\r\\ntake the long way round.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAll right, then we cut through the Commercial District!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYes!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Meanwhile, Fiora rushes into the Residential District, still carrying a \\r\\ncylinder case, and looks back as the pillar back at Central Plaza falls. She \\r\\nthen takes note of the mobile artillery sitting inert in the street.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shortly, as Shulk, Reyn and Dunban exit the Commercial District, Dunban \\r\\ncollapses in agony, no longer able to bear the Monado, which skitters along the\\r\\nbridge and deactivates. The other two hurry over to him.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nDunban!\\r\\nYou can\\'t take any more of the Monado!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nBut I must!\\r\\nI don\\'t have a choice!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban stretches out his hand to reach for the sword but instead coughs up \\r\\nblood on the ground.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn\\'s right.\\r\\nYou can\\'t go on like this.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDunban.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk sees Mechon approaching from across the bridge - and he rushes for the \\r\\nMonado. Shulk picks up the weapon and activates it.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThis time...\\r\\nIt\\'s my turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nShulk, no!\\r\\nIt\\'ll kill you!\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk at first struggles with the Monado, but then seems to master himself and\\r\\ncharges at the enemy, yelling. As he does, the screen flashes to white as time \\r\\nslows down to a crawl.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat\\'s happening?\\r\\n\\r\\n[One Mechon sends an energy blast that knocks Shulk backwards. But back in the \\r\\npresent it hasn\\'t happened yet, so Shulk dodges the attack with ease.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWhat the?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The attack then strikes a wall behind Reyn and Dunban, causing a massive \\r\\nexplosion in the background. Shulk proceeds to destroy that Mechon. As another \\r\\nMechon attacks, Shulk sees its movements in the future and deftly evades them, \\r\\nsoon cutting the Mechon down.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWow. Shulk\\'s pretty awesome!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nHow can this be?\\r\\nShulk is using the Monado.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat was that?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk! More company!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nReyn!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Both Reyn and Dunban rise to their feet.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nRight!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban, now wielding a Homs Sabre, beats off a Mechon that had been advancing \\r\\ntowards Shulk.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn!\\r\\nDunban!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Reyn begin hacking away at more Mechon.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI got your back!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nShulk, do you feel all right?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI\\'m OK.\\r\\nBut there was something strange.\\r\\nJust now,\\r\\nit was as if I could see into the future.\\r\\nIs this another power of the Monado?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nSee into the future?\\r\\nWhat are ya saying?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAre you certain? Shulk!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI see.\\r\\nI remember Dickson saying that\\r\\nthe Monado had a hidden power.\\r\\nCould this be it?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat?\\r\\n\\r\\n[The three run to meet more Mechon.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nDon\\'t think about it now!\\r\\nJust believe what the Monado\\r\\nshowed you and fight!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nGot it!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party fight off this latest wave of Mechon as they emerge from the bridge.\\r\\nThey then rush into the Residential District. As they arrive, however, the huge\\r\\nblack Mechon with the metal face becomes an obstacle in their path.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIt\\'s massive.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nThat Mechon...\\r\\nIt has a face?!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThat don\\'t mean nothin\\'!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThat\\'s right!\\r\\nNot when we have the Monado!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The three engage Metal Face in battle, but their weapons are ineffective, even\\r\\nthe Monado.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThe Monado! It\\'s not working!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nOi! What d\\'ya mean?!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nHow can that be?\\r\\nThe Monado should cut through\\r\\nMechon with ease!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk notices a blue light on the back of Metal Face\\'s frame.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat is that light?\\r\\nOther Mechon don\\'t have that.\\r\\nCould...\\r\\nCould that light be why the\\r\\nMonado has no effect?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nShulk! Reyn! Get down!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban pulls the other two away just before Metal Face\\'s claws strike the \\r\\nground where they had been.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nStay back! I\\'ll take it from here!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nNo!\\r\\nYou can\\'t take any more!\\r\\n\\r\\n[But Dunban has taken off, and Reyn goes after him. Metal Face simply knocks \\r\\nthem both back with its clawed hand. The Mechon then comes over and does the \\r\\nsame to Shulk. Metal Face is about to go in for the kill when, out of nowhere, \\r\\nthe Mechon is hit with a heavy blast that practically knocks it to the ground.\\r\\nIt is soon shown that the attack has come from the mobile artillery - piloted \\r\\nby Fiora.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nEveryone.\\r\\nGet away, right now!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nFiora!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora\\'s artillery tears through Mechon as she approaches Metal Face. As she \\r\\ncharges ahead, Shulk\\'s eyes glow blue as a vision comes to him: An attack from \\r\\nMetal Face blasts Fiora\\'s artillery into pieces, crippling the vehicle. While \\r\\nFiora is trapped inside, Metal Face comes over and stabs her with its claws. \\r\\nBack in the present, Shulk is still on the ground and coming to grips with what\\r\\nhe\\'s just been shown.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat did I just...\\r\\nFiora!\\r\\nGet back!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora\\'s vehicle continues to advance.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nI won\\'t let you hurt any more people!\\r\\nWe will save Colony 9!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora activates the artillery\\'s cannons, opening fire on Metal Face. They have\\r\\nno effect. Metal Face generates a ball of blue light, which it then fires at \\r\\nFiora, blowing the cannon off the vehicle as Fiora yelps in fright. She then \\r\\nopens fire with the other cannon, concentrating fire on Metal Face.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFiora! Get out of here! Run!\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nYou want more?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[She then shoves the foremost cannon right in the Mechon\\'s face, covering it. \\r\\nWith a grunt of concentration, she lets loose a tremendous blast that blows \\r\\nher artillery and Metal Face backwards. Her artillery falls on its side, now \\r\\ninoperable. Fiora then sees Metal Face emerge from the smoke, unharmed except \\r\\nfor some superficial damage to its faceplate. It marches towards her.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nHow?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Metal Face then lifts the artillery so that it is eye to eye with Fiora; she \\r\\nwhimpers, losing hope. The Mechon then slams the mobile artillery against a \\r\\nnearby house, smashing the vehicle into pieces as Fiora cries out in fear.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFiora!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Both Shulk and Dunban are still on the ground, helpless to intervene as \\r\\nMetal Face approaches the fallen mobile artillery with Fiora trapped inside. \\r\\nShulk screams in horror.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNo!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Metal Face plunges its claws into the vehicle, and Fiora\\'s screams are cut \\r\\nshort. Shulk and Dunban can only look on, horrified. As Shulk struggles to \\r\\nrise, Metal Face casually tosses Fiora\\'s artillery over its shoulder, allowing \\r\\nother Mechon behind it to converge on the vehicle. Shulk, now on his feet, sees\\r\\nFiora\\'s blood coating Metal Face\\'s claws.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI\\'ll kill you!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk attempts to fight Metal Face, and his two companions join him. But the \\r\\nbattle is just as futile as before. Shulk uses the Monado to keep Metal Face\\'s\\r\\nclaws at bay, then climbs up its arm and charges towards its faceplate, the \\r\\nMonado drawn.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDie!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Monado\\'s blade is embedded in Metal Face\\'s head, but the Mechon simply \\r\\nswats Shulk and his weapon to the ground. Reyn runs over to him.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Metal Face\\'s red eyes flash, as though sending a signal to the other Mechon. \\r\\nThe Face then takes a moment to stare at Dunban before rising into the sky and \\r\\njoining the rest of the retreating Mechon.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nGet back here!\\r\\n\\r\\n[But the three are left alone in the burning colony.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNo!\\r\\n\\r\\n[A new day dawns, and there is calm. The colony is in disarray, but the damage\\r\\nis salvageable. Birds are singing as Shulk sits alone at Outlook Park.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFiora...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Flashback to Shulk and Fiora at Outlook Park before the Mechon assault.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nThe breeze feels so good.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\nI\\'d forgotten what it feels like.\\r\\nI never thought it could be so quiet here.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nYou\\'re spending too much time with Reyn.\\r\\nYou\\'re getting used to all the noise he makes.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah, maybe.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The two share a laugh.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nIt\\'s so peaceful.\\r\\nYou know, Shulk,\\r\\nI hope every day can be like this, always.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Back to the present. Reyn comes over to Shulk at the park.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHey.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The two are standing, looking out over the colony.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHave you been to see Dunban?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI just can\\'t do it.\\r\\nYou got more guts than me.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNot at all.\\r\\nIt was him that consoled me.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI guess that\\'s the type of guy he is.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\nEven without the Monado, he\\'s the strongest person I know.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Flashback to Shulk at Dunban\\'s House in the aftermath of the attack.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nUh...\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nShulk. How are you holding up?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI\\'m fine.\\r\\nBut...you...\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI will shed no tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nHuh?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nA year ago, I felt the same sense\\r\\nof deep loss that I do now.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThe Battle of Sword Valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAfter that battle, many of my friends did not make it home.\\r\\nWhile I was being brought here on that stretcher,\\r\\nthey were all I thought about.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk makes a sympathetic noise.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nBut I decided I would not cry.\\r\\nEveryone who died in that war had\\r\\nsomething they wanted to protect.\\r\\nFamily, friends, loved ones, their home...\\r\\nSo they fought to protect them.\\r\\nAnd we won.\\r\\n\\r\\n[A view of Dunban\\'s portrait of himself with Mumkhar and Dickson.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nNo matter how painful, no matter how hard,\\r\\nit\\'s nothing to be sad about...\\r\\nI decided that there and then.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDunban!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nShulk, Fiora would tell you the same thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk inhales sharply.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nShe wanted to protect us.

It\\'s a bit of a loudmouth!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThere you go then!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The two laugh together.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nSo when are we heading off?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nRight now.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nPerfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Reyn leave Colony 9\\'s Commercial District via the Main Entrance.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nRight then.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\n\\r\\n[From his house across the bridge, Dunban watches the two depart.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nLook after yourselves, boys.\\r\\n\\r\\n[He grabs his injured arm.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAs soon as this heals,\\r\\nI\\'ll be right behind you.\\r\\nAnd then we will seize our destiny.\\r\\nTogether.\\r\\n\\r\\n[A view of Dickson listening in from around the corner.]\\r\\n\\r\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nCHAPTER 3\\r\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n- Fourteen Years Ago -\\r\\n\\r\\n[A group of explorers brave a blizzard through a snowy mountain terrain; a \\r\\nchild is among them.

After they \\r\\nenter, a blue beam of light is emitted from the base of the tower outside.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later, after the blizzard, Dickson struggles through the snow, breathing hard,\\r\\nand opens the doors of the tower. He cries out as he discovers the whole team \\r\\ndead. Dickson finds only one survivor - the small boy, who is asleep at the \\r\\nfoot of the altar where the Monado is held. Dickson takes the boy and then \\r\\nexits the tower.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Back in the present, Shulk and Reyn embark on their new journey, but not \\r\\nbefore Shulk stops just outside Colony 9.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s all very well going after that metal-faced Mechon.\\r\\nBut shouldn\\'t we have some kind of plan?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHow about checking out Colony 6?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nColony 6...\\r\\nThe only other Homs colony left.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nColony 6 is on the way to Sword Valley, where\\r\\nthere\\'s supposed to be a Mechon base.\\r\\nIf that\\'s where they came from, maybe\\r\\nthe people in Colony 6 saw something.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nGood point. They might even know something\\r\\nabout that metal-faced Mechon.\\r\\nSo we go past the Mag Mell Ruins and up through\\r\\nTephra Cave. Then we should arrive at the Bionis\\' knee.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\nAnd if we can get to the knee, it ain\\'t far to Colony 6, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSounds like a plan!\\r\\nLet\\'s head to Colony 6.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later, at Mag Mell Ruins in Tephra Cave, Shulk and Reyn arrive at a green-lit\\r\\ndoor that had previously been lit red.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThis door...\\r\\nIt was closed when we came past\\r\\nbefore, but it\\'s open now.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nMaybe it was programmed to open up\\r\\nin case of Mechon emergency.\\r\\nThe way to the Bionis\\' knee\\r\\nis just ahead.

But if armed traders need guideposts,\\r\\nit must be pretty dangerous in here.\\r\\nLet\\'s keep our wits about us.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDefinitely.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later, at one of the cave\\'s pools, Shulk and Reyn come across the bodies of \\r\\nnumerous dead traders.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat the...?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nLook at the emblem.\\r\\nThey\\'re traders from Colony 6.\\r\\nNo wonder it\\'s been so long\\r\\nsince the last delivery.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn, their injuries...\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThey weren\\'t made by no Mechon.\\r\\nIt was probably the monsters that live here.\\r\\nMan, that\\'s grim. I don\\'t wanna go like this. Not even\\r\\nkilled by Mechon, just some monsters in a cave.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThey probably had families...children...\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nMaybe. It wouldn\\'t surprise me.\\r\\nBut why do you say that?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNo reason.\\r\\nReyn, shouldn\\'t we return\\r\\nthem to the Bionis?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nOh, right.\\r\\nWhat\\'s born from the Bionis is returned to the Bionis.\\r\\nThat\\'s the way of the Homs.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The two perform this duty for the deceased traders, pausing at the pool when \\r\\nthey\\'re finished.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThat was way harder than I thought it\\'d be.\\r\\nI\\'m just about ready to collapse!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nLet\\'s take a rest.\\r\\nIf the monsters in here killed all these\\r\\ntraders, we need to be at our best.\\r\\nI\\'m wide awake, so I\\'ll take first watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThanks, man. The nap\\'ll do me good.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Some time later, Shulk is sitting by a fire as Reyn comes up to him.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk. My turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nAwake already?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nDidn\\'t sleep a wink. And I still feel like\\r\\nI just did one of Vangarre\\'s drills!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nHeh.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHey... Why do you think the Mechon attacked?\\r\\nAre we just food to them?\\r\\nOr, what, did we do something wrong?\\r\\nSort of reminds me of the battle between\\r\\nthe Bionis and the Mechonis.\\r\\nI wonder if it\\'s anything to do with that?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWell...\\r\\nIt\\'s hard to believe that living things\\r\\nare just a source of energy for machines.\\r\\nThere has to be another reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThe Mechon killed Fiora.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou know what? I\\'ll never forgive \\'em.\\r\\nI don\\'t care what their reason is.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nHmm.\\r\\nWhen it happened, the Monado showed me\\r\\nthat Fiora was in danger.\\r\\nBut I couldn\\'t save her.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIt\\'s not your fault.\\r\\nJust \\'cos the Monado showed you some future,\\r\\nthat don\\'t mean you could do anything about it.\\r\\nYou did great. You fought them off.\\r\\nI couldn\\'t have done that.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn sits down.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou know, I\\'ve been thinking about it.\\r\\nWhy you can use the Monado, I mean.\\r\\nDickson told me.\\r\\nYou\\'re a survivor from the Monado expedition\\r\\nteam that went out 14 years ago.\\r\\nThere was a blizzard or something\\r\\nand your mum and dad died.\\r\\nAnd then Dickson found you and brought you back.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThat sounds right. I was pretty young,\\r\\nso I don\\'t really remember anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIs that why you do it?\\r\\nWhy you\\'re always helping Dickson with his research\\r\\nand trying to figure out the Monado?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMaybe.\\r\\nPart of me does see it as something\\r\\nto remind me of my mum and dad.\\r\\nBut mainly, if it really is the sword that the Bionis\\r\\nused to kill the Mechonis, like in the legend...\\r\\nI want to work out its secret.\\r\\nThat\\'s the real reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn has stood up and come around the fire to face Shulk.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI\\'ve got it! You were chosen.\\r\\nBy the Monado.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat? Chosen?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nDon\\'t you see? Not even Dunban can handle it.\\r\\nIt ain\\'t chance that you can and he can\\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk makes a skeptical sound.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI\\'ll take the next watch.\\r\\nYou get some rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nOK, I\\'ll try.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk walks off as Reyn prepares for his watch.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNight, Reyn.\\r\\n\\r\\n[In a hazy dream world, Shulk finds himself at the top of a dark tower. There \\r\\nis someone else with him on the other side of the haze; this unfamiliar person \\r\\naddresses Shulk.]\\r\\n\\r\\n???\\r\\nDo you wish to change it?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk makes a questioning sound.]\\r\\n\\r\\n???\\r\\nThe future.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk huffs but doesn\\'t have an answer.]\\r\\n\\r\\n???\\r\\nIt is every man\\'s desire to change the future.\\r\\nIs that not so?\\r\\nEven if everything has been predestined,\\r\\nwill you not oppose it?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI...\\r\\n\\r\\n???\\r\\nThe Monado is now in your hands.\\r\\nThe Monado will grow with you.\\r\\nIf you can find the True Monado\\r\\nthe future is yours.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThe True Monado?\\r\\n\\r\\n[The mysterious young man waves farewell as Shulk suddenly hears Reyn\\'s voice.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\n\\r\\n[In a vision, Shulk sees Reyn surrounded by Arachno monsters.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn!\\r\\n\\r\\n[As Reyn is surrounded by Soldier Arachnos, the Arachno Queen comes up from \\r\\nbehind and attacks him.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Arachno Queen strikes the killing blow right as Shulk is jolted awake.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk gets to his feet to find Reyn and himself surrounded by all the Arachnos\\r\\nfrom his dream.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat\\'re ya playing at?!\\r\\nGive us a hand!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk activates the Monado, and together the pair eradicate the monsters.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI\\'m sorry, Reyn.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nDon\\'t worry about it.

[V.O.]\\r\\nThe Monado is now in your hands.\\r\\nThe Monado will grow with you.\\r\\nIf you can find the True Monado,\\r\\nthe future is yours.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThe True Monado?\\r\\nWas I dreaming?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat\\'s with you?\\r\\nWe\\'d better get a move on.\\r\\n\\r\\n[As Reyn makes to depart, Shulk gets another vision of Reyn surrounded by \\r\\nArachnos, then being killed by the Arachno Queen.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk [inwardly]\\r\\nIt wasn\\'t a dream.\\r\\nWas it a vision?\\r\\nWhat should I do?

I don\\'t know...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Deeper within Tephra Cave, Shulk and Reyn come across a pair of Pods.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat on Bionis are those?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMonsters\\' egg sacs...I think...

What kind of monsters are they?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nProbably some type of Arachno...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk sees another vision of Reyn being slain by the Arachno Queen.

Ahh!\\r\\n\\r\\n[He is then taken up through the ceiling of the cave.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn!\\r\\nNo! If that vision comes true, then Reyn...!\\r\\nI\\'ve gotta find him!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk reaches Vilia Lake, where he sees Reyn on an upper level of the cave,\\r\\nrunning away from a small group of Arachnos.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou things just don\\'t give up, do ya?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk surveys the terrain in front of him and sees some ivy growing on a \\r\\npillar in the underground lake.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI\\'ve gotta hurry.

I just realised something.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHuh?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThe future I see... It isn\\'t set.\\r\\nI think it\\'s more like a warning.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nA warning?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah... A warning about what will happen.\\r\\nWhat will happen if I don\\'t do anything,\\r\\nor if I can\\'t do anything.\\r\\nSo I can use this power to change the future.\\r\\nAnd that\\'s exactly what I intend to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou\\'ve got my vote.\\r\\nAnd if you really can do that...\\r\\nI think Fiora would have liked it too.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nRight, let\\'s get moving.\\r\\nWe\\'re nearly at the Bionis\\' knee.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Reyn emerge from Tephra Cave on Kneecap Hill and find a picturesque\\r\\nview of Bionis and Mechonis, both looming far overhead.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWow!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nNo matter how many times I see this,\\r\\nI never get used to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The pair turn to face the Mechonis.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nOn the other side of those clouds...\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYep.\\r\\nIt\\'s our enemy.\\r\\nMechonis.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk clinches his fist.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nOur enemy...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Meanwhile, a Mechon scout unit has spotted the two.

Which means Colony 6 is up ahead!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The two spot some ivy growing on the rock face nearby.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nLooks like we can climb up there.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nGreat! I love a good climb.\\r\\n\\r\\n[They both make the short climb up and continue on through Leg Pass onto the \\r\\nRagrinar Canyon Path.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Bionis area intro: Bionis\\' Leg]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Upon arriving at the wide, grassy fields of Gaur Plain, the two see smoke in \\r\\nthe distance.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk!

Who would just\\r\\nabandon a buggy in this place?\\r\\nAnd it\\'s pretty new.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIs it brand new?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNot brand new. But it\\'s in very good condition.\\r\\nYou wouldn\\'t just abandon it.\\r\\nSo what did happen to the driver?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk reaches out his hand to the buggy, then sees a vision of a teenaged boy \\r\\nbeing chased by a pair of Berserk Ardun.

Where?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI don\\'t know! But it was near some water.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nNear water... But what made you\\r\\nhave a vision all of a sudden?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMaybe it was triggered by touching the buggy.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWell, we\\'d better find him. Let\\'s search\\r\\neverywhere round here where there\\'s water!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nOK!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Reyn seem to have found their quarry when their search takes them to\\r\\nRho Oasis.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk! Over there!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The boy is on the ground and at the mercy of the two Ardun.]\\r\\n\\r\\n???\\r\\nArghhhh!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Reyn run in.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou all right, kid?\\r\\n\\r\\n???\\r\\nWho are you?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThat can wait. Go! Get outta here!\\r\\nLeave these guys to us.\\r\\n\\r\\n???\\r\\nOK!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The boy gets to his feet and dashes off.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nLet\\'s do this!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nReady when you are!\\r\\n\\r\\n[After killing both Berserk Ardun, Shulk and Reyn meet the boy at his buggy. \\r\\nShulk gives it a quick fix.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nOK. It should work now.\\r\\n\\r\\n???\\r\\nGreat. You saved my skin! My buggy short-circuited,\\r\\nand then there were those monsters, and... Well, thanks!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI fixed the circuit, but it\\'s out of ether.\\r\\nChange the cylinder and it\\'ll be as good as new.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI think it\\'s time for the introductions.\\r\\nI\\'m Reyn.

It\\'s not far.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHow about it?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nLet\\'s take him up on the offer. I\\'m surprised there\\'s a\\r\\nHoms camp here, but they might have some information.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nJuju, can you tell us how to get there?\\r\\n\\r\\nJuju\\r\\nSure!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view shifts to Rho Oasis and beyond it, Kamos Guidepost.]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuju\\r\\nIf you go back to the oasis,\\r\\nyou should see a tall stone post.\\r\\nHead there first.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view returns to the party.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThen what?\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view shifts closer to Kamos Guidepost, showing the woods and narrow valley\\r\\nbeyond it.]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuju\\r\\nThere\\'s a small path in the\\r\\nwoods next to the stone post.\\r\\nJust follow it down to our camp.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view returns to the party again.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nGot it.

To Colony 6?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nActually, we\\'re heading there ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nColony 6 has been...\\r\\nOur home!\\r\\nIt\\'s been occupied by the Mechon.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Reyn react in shock to this news.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nI\\'ll tell you about it inside.\\r\\nFollow me.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Reyn follow Sharla and Juju into the cave where the refugees from \\r\\nColony 6 have set up camp.

We\\'re up for some revenge.\\r\\nI bet we can even get your colony back!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThere you go showing off again...\\r\\n\\r\\nJuju\\r\\nIf anyone can do it, it\\'s you two.\\r\\nCould...um... Could you take\\r\\nme with you to the colony?!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nJuju!\\r\\nThe people here need us!\\r\\nHow many times do I have to tell you?\\r\\n\\r\\nJuju\\r\\nBut you heard. The Mechon attacked Colony 9!\\r\\nThat means a load of them have\\r\\nleft Colony 6 already! It has to!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nEven if that\\'s true... No, especially if it\\'s true!\\r\\nWe cannot expose the camp to any more danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuju\\r\\nSo you don\\'t care what happens\\r\\nto the people in the colony?!\\r\\nHow can you be so heartless?\\r\\nAre you that scared of the Mechon?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk then sees another vision of the tentacled Mechon in a rocky valley\\r\\nsurrounded by flames.

Everything\\'s engulfed in flames...\\r\\nThere\\'s a black shadow...\\r\\nIt kills Juju.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIs it the Mechon with the metal face?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhere does it happen?\\r\\nIs it near Colony 6?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI\\'m not sure. I think so.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nLet\\'s get after him, Shulk!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Reyn begin to leave.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nHold on a second! What was all that about?\\r\\n\\r\\n[The three continue onwards a bit before stopping.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI know you won\\'t believe this...\\r\\nbut Shulk can see the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThe future? That\\'s not possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThat\\'s what I thought too.\\r\\nI still can\\'t explain this.\\r\\nBut that vision will come true unless we stop it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nSo you\\'re telling me Juju\\'s in danger?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nBelieve it or don\\'t believe it, that\\'s your call.\\r\\nBut I wouldn\\'t be standing here\\r\\nif it weren\\'t for Shulk\\'s visions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nJuju...\\r\\nOK.\\r\\nI can\\'t say I believe you.\\r\\nBut what have I got to lose?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI like the way you think!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSharla, you\\'re...\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nWhat?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNo, nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat are you doing?\\r\\nLet\\'s go and find Juju!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nWhen you talk like that you\\r\\nsound just like Gadolt!\\r\\nThat\\'s how I know it\\'s not worth arguing.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat am I, some kind of Gadolt substitute?\\r\\n\\r\\n[As the two continue on, Shulk is left alone with his thoughts.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk [inwardly]\\r\\nThat thing kills Sharla too.\\r\\nI saw it in the vision.\\r\\nBut I can\\'t stop her coming with us.\\r\\nI don\\'t know how I can protect her.\\r\\nBut I have to do it.\\r\\nI WILL change the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk, Reyn and Sharla pause after leaving the Refugee Camp and coming near \\r\\nKamos Guidepost.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nSharla, do you know which way Juju went?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThere are quite a few ways to get there from here,\\r\\nbut he\\'s in a buggy, so I think he\\'ll take Raguel Bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view has panned in the direction of this bridge.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nRaguel Bridge?\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view shifts to Raguel Bridge itself.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nIt\\'s not far. It\\'s a really old bridge. Built\\r\\naround the time Colony 9 was founded.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view returns to the party at Kamos Guidepost.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nOK. Let\\'s make that our next stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nSounds like a plan!\\r\\nSharla, you stay back. Leave any\\r\\nmonsters up to me and Shulk.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nWhat, you think I can\\'t pull my weight in battle?\\r\\nI\\'ve got field experience as a medic.\\r\\nIf you get hurt, I can use ether to patch you up.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nNice! I\\'m always getting roughed up.\\r\\nYou\\'ll be a big help!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Meanwhile at Raguel Bridge, Juju is stranded after the buggy has crashed.]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuju\\r\\nCome on! Who put this barrier in the way?\\r\\nNow the front suspension\\'s\\r\\nall twisted up!\\r\\nLooks like I have to walk it.\\r\\nThey\\'re all cowards.\\r\\nI\\'ll show them all.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Juju sets off across the bridge. A short time later, the other three arrive.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHey, Sharla! Look!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nIt\\'s Juju\\'s buggy!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Touching the buggy, Shulk sees a vision of Juju alone in that same deep \\r\\nvalley. Suddenly Mechon Tentacles break through the ground and attack him.]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuju\\r\\nWhat is that thing?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The vision ends when a pincer at the end of a tentacle lunges at Juju, who \\r\\ncries out in distress.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nJuju!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat is it?!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s Juju!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nShulk! Is he OK?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk hesitates.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nTell me!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThere\\'s a Mechon... It\\'s taken Juju!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sharla makes a despairing noise.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhen?!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI\\'m not sure. But I don\\'t think\\r\\nwe\\'ve got much time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nYou said you saw a deep valley, didn\\'t you?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThere\\'s a place like that just up ahead.\\r\\nAnd it\\'s even on the way to Colony 6.\\r\\nThat must be the route Juju\\'s taking.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou sure? No other deep valleys round here?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nNot as far as I know.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWell, Shulk?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nLet\\'s move. That has to be where Juju is.\\r\\n\\r\\n[After crossing Raguel Bridge, Reyn halts.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIs this the place you were on about?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThis is it all right. At the end of the road\\r\\nthere\\'s a path to Colony 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nBut there\\'s no sign of Juju. If my vision was right,\\r\\nhe should be around here somewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nI\\'m sure he would have gone along this road.\\r\\nI just hope nothing\\'s happened to him yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn faces the nearby Windy Cave.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nAny chance he went up that way?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nIt\\'s not safe around here.\\r\\nI doubt Juju would go off the beaten\\r\\ntrack if he could avoid it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nGot it. We\\'ll search along the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk, Reyn and Sharla eventually arrive at Spiral Valley to find Juju already\\r\\nin the clutches of a tentacled Mechon, crying out for help.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nJuju!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sharla outruns the two boys and rushes up alone.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nJuju!\\r\\nHold on, I\\'m coming!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWait! Sharla!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk is in a vision where he sees a Mechon Tentacle spring forth from the \\r\\nground, knocking Sharla high into the air.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nJuju!\\r\\n\\r\\n[She screams in despair as the pincer grabs her in mid-air. Back in the \\r\\npresent, the Monado activates, showing a new symbol.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nAnother new symbol\\'s appeared on the Monado!\\r\\nCan I save her?\\r\\n\\r\\n??? [V.O.]\\r\\nOf course you can.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk runs forward and uses the Monado to send a shockwave across the rocky \\r\\nplatform. Sharla now glows blue as she puts on a burst of Speed and outruns the\\r\\nMechon Tentacle attack. She is astonished to turn around and see not only the \\r\\ntentacle but that Shulk has already bisected it with his blade.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nShulk?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Reyn rush to Sharla\\'s side.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIts tentacles could come out from\\r\\nunder the ground at any second.\\r\\nOne false move and you\\'re done for.\\r\\nWait for my order!\\r\\nReyn, you got my back?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\n\\'Course! Leave it to me!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk rushes at the Mechon. In a vision, more tentacles attack, and one also\\r\\nshoots a burst of fire at him. Back in the present, he slashes the attacking \\r\\ntentacles, dodges the incoming fire and finally slices through the firing \\r\\nMechon pincer. Reyn, also buffed by Monado Speed, dashes past numerous \\r\\ntentacles coming from the ground, as does Sharla, shooting at the tentacles \\r\\nwith her rifle. She stands back to back with Shulk.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nAmazing!\\r\\nI didn\\'t know you could do that!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s not me.\\r\\nIt\\'s the power of the Monado.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn comes in to join them.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThat\\'s right.\\r\\nAnd the light swirling around us...\\r\\nThat\\'s the Monado \\'n\\' all.\\r\\nSharla!\\r\\nLet\\'s move!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The three turn to face the Mechon M71 together.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[After subduing the tentacled Mechon in battle, the three are winded.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIs it down?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[But the Mechon M71, still holding Juju, uses its tentacles to grab the rocky \\r\\noverhang and pull itself up on top of the platform above.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nGet back here!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s up there! Let\\'s go after it!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nRight!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The three give chase and engage the machine in another fight. Near the \\r\\nbattle\\'s end, Shulk slices yet another Mechon Tentacle with the Monado.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn runs in, leaps and grabs Juju out of the Mechon\\'s pincer as the Mechon \\r\\nbursts apart, destroyed at last. Sharla runs towards them.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nJuju! Are you all right?!\\r\\n\\r\\nJuju\\r\\nSharla...\\r\\nI\\'m sorry.\\r\\n\\r\\n[As Juju gets to his feet, Sharla first slaps him, then embraces him.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nI\\'m so glad you\\'re OK.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHey! Looks like we changed the future!\\r\\n\\r\\n[But Shulk doesn\\'t respond.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat\\'s up?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWell, it\\'s just that...\\r\\nThat can\\'t have been the\\r\\nMechon from my vision.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYeah, weren\\'t it supposed to be\\r\\nthat one with the face.\\r\\nI guess we changed more\\r\\nthan we expected!\\r\\nShulk?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNo.\\r\\nSomething\\'s not right.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Just then, a large Mechon appears overhead. Sharla gasps and holds Juju close \\r\\nto her.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nJuju!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The mysterious Mechon unfolds itself and lands, revealing that it has a face. \\r\\nBut this one is a bronze-faced Mechon, not the black metal-faced one from the \\r\\nattack on Colony 9.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNo!\\r\\nIt\\'s not him at all!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nBut this one\\'s got a face \\'n\\' all!\\r\\n\\r\\nMysterious Face\\r\\nI\\'ve been waiting for you,\\r\\nMonado boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Reyn recoil at the words.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat? It spoke!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Face steps in, prompting the two to move backwards.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMysterious Face\\r\\nThe way Metal Face scarpered\\r\\nI thought you\\'d have to be this big scary monster.\\r\\nBut look.\\r\\nYou\\'re just some pathetic little kid!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Face wields its massive hammer and prepares for battle.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[The fight against the Mysterious Face does not go well. The Mechon rounds on \\r\\nJuju and grabs him with its metallic hand.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nJuju!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The foe then shows off its new catch to Shulk\\'s party.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nJuju!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou pile of junk!\\r\\nLet him go!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Reyn rush at the bronze-faced Mechon. Its red eyes blink, \\r\\ntransmitting a signal.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn!\\r\\nBetter watch your back!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nGot it!\\r\\n\\r\\n[A couple Mechon drop in from the sky. Reyn hangs back to deal with them.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nCheers, Shulk!\\r\\n\\r\\nMysterious Face\\r\\nYou little...\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Mechon swings its hammer at Shulk and misses. Shulk swings the Monado at \\r\\nit, but his blade just clangs off its armour. The Face redoubles its attacks, \\r\\nsending Shulk running.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhy? Why can\\'t I use the Monado?!\\r\\nIt\\'s only the ones that have faces.\\r\\nBut...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk ducks an incoming hammer swing.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI can still see what it\\'s going to do!\\r\\nJust like before!\\r\\n\\r\\nMysterious Face\\r\\nNice tricks you got there, pipsqueak!\\r\\nDarting around the place!\\r\\nThat the Monado\\'s power?\\r\\nWon\\'t matter, you\\'re still flesh and blood,\\r\\nand I reckon you\\'re nearly done!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Another Mechon flies in to attack Shulk, but Reyn beats it off.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMysterious Face\\r\\nBehind you!\\r\\n\\r\\n[More Mechon land.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\nLeave these to me!\\r\\nGo take him out!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk dashes towards the Face.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nGot it!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mysterious Face punches at Shulk, stopping him. It brings its hammer down, but\\r\\nSharla\\'s rifle shot stops the attack cold.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nNow!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nRight!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn stabs at the Face with his driver, but it\\'s no use.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIt\\'s just bouncing off \\'im!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Mechon rises into the air...]\\r\\n\\r\\nMysterious Face\\r\\nThat was fun for a while.\\r\\nBut now I\\'m bored!\\r\\n\\r\\n[...and comes crashing down, its hammer creating a massive shockwave that sends\\r\\nall three party members flying backwards, screaming.]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuju\\r\\nSharla!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sharla, her rifle on the ground, is dangling over the cliff edge, holding on \\r\\nwith only one hand. The Face raises its hammer against Shulk.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMysterious Face\\r\\nTime to finish you off!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk! Look out!\\r\\n\\r\\n[A close-up of Mysterious Face\\'s shell reveals the flowing red lines starting \\r\\nto turn green. The Face stops its attack.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMysterious Face\\r\\nLooks like my time here\\'s up.\\r\\nIt\\'s your lucky day, little boy!\\r\\nBut that luck won\\'t last forever.\\r\\n\\r\\n[As Shulk questions what\\'s going on, the Face shows Juju to the party, still \\r\\nstruggling in its mechanical grasp.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMysterious Face\\r\\nI\\'ll keep hold of this brat.\\r\\nIf you want him back you\\'d\\r\\nbetter come to Colony 6.\\r\\nBut you\\'ll have to be be quick.\\r\\nI\\'m feeling hungry!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou! You\\'re gonna pay!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The bronze-faced Mechon laughs as it takes off skyward.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMysterious Face\\r\\nI can\\'t wait to grind you\\r\\nall into dust!\\r\\n\\r\\nJuju\\r\\nSharla! Sharla!\\r\\nNo!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk watches helplessly as the other Mechon take off and join the Face; they\\r\\nall disappear into the sky. Sharla pulls herself up over the ledge, panting.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nJuju...\\r\\n\\r\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nCHAPTER 5\\r\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n[Flashback to Sharla and Juju together inside a base at Colony 6. A man runs in\\r\\nto join them.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nGadolt!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Gadolt hands his rifle to Sharla.]\\r\\n\\r\\nGadolt\\r\\nIt\\'s only been a year since\\r\\nthe Battle of Sword Valley.\\r\\nHow?\\r\\nHow did their numbers grow so quickly?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Gadolt watches Sharla work on his rifle as an older man enters.]\\r\\n\\r\\n???\\r\\nAre their numbers too great\\r\\neven for you, Gadolt?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nOtharon.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The older man, Otharon, hesitates and seems pained.]\\r\\n\\r\\nOtharon\\r\\nMedic Sharla, here are your new orders.\\r\\nYou and Juju are to ready the evac ships.\\r\\nYou will be in charge of the evacuation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sharla and Juju share a look, clearly unhappy with these orders.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nBut...\\r\\n\\r\\nOtharon\\r\\nYou must realise, the ships can only carry so many.\\r\\nWe must stay behind and fight to protect\\r\\nthose who remain in Colony 6.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sharla groans and looks to Gadolt.]\\r\\n\\r\\nGadolt\\r\\nI\\'ll be fine.\\r\\nI\\'ll be able to keep my mind on the\\r\\nbattle knowing you\\'re safe.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sharla clutches Gadolt\\'s Rifle as he moves to put a reassuring hand on her.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nPromise me.\\r\\n\\r\\nGadolt\\r\\nSharla...\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nPromise that you\\'ll meet us\\r\\noutside the colony.\\r\\nI...\\r\\nJust make sure you get out of here alive!\\r\\n\\r\\n[She offers him back his rifle.]\\r\\n\\r\\nGadolt\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\n\\r\\n[He takes it and begins to leave.]\\r\\n\\r\\nGadolt\\r\\nI promise.\\r\\nDon\\'t worry.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later, elsewhere in the colony, children are preparing hover transports as \\r\\nSharla stands nearby.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla [inwardly]\\r\\nGadolt.\\r\\nA promise is a promise.\\r\\nAnd until I see you again,\\r\\nI will protect everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Gadolt walks towards the flames of war, waving back at Sharla, but a \\r\\nmysterious, sinister voice interrupts the moment.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMysterious Face [V.O.]\\r\\nNo, let me protect everyone!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Flash forward to the bronze-faced Mechon holding Juju in its clutches at \\r\\nSpiral Valley.]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuju\\r\\nSharla!\\r\\n\\r\\nMysterious Face\\r\\nI keep \\'em real safe!\\r\\nInside my belly!\\r\\n\\r\\nJuju\\r\\nSharla!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nJuju!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Back in the present, Sharla bolts upright in bed.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nJuju!\\r\\n\\r\\n[She looks around to see she\\'s back inside the cave at the Refugee Camp.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nWhere are you?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sharla soon gets up and heads outside, where she finds Shulk and Reyn.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nHey there.

So that\\'s what it\\'s called.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nA mystical beast that protects the Bionis.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nSo, what\\'s your plan from here?\\r\\nFollow that metal-faced machine, I presume?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat else? He\\'s gonna pay for what he did to Fiora.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWell then. There\\'s only one place he\\'d go.\\r\\nGalahad Fortress in Sword Valley.\\r\\nA year ago, those things were building a\\r\\nhuge fortress, right in the valley.\\r\\nTactically, it\\'s an excellent location to launch attacks from.\\r\\nI feel there\\'s a strong chance they\\'ve now finished building it.\\r\\nThat would explain why both\\r\\ncolonies were attacked recently.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtharon\\r\\nSword Valley... The very place where\\r\\nwe made our last stand one year ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nSo it\\'s settled. Bash down a fortress and\\r\\nsmash some metal brains!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nEasy, Reyn.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThere\\'s somewhere else I need to go first.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nBut what could be more important than...\\r\\nWait... You saw another one.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nSaw what? What\\'re you on about?\\r\\n\\r\\n[After Shulk\\'s visions have been explained to the others...]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nThese visions sound pretty handy.\\r\\nWell, out with it. What d\\'ya see?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI was somewhere very high up.\\r\\nI was fighting at the peak of a huge tower.\\r\\nFighting Metal Face.\\r\\nI heard a voice, and then the Monado\\'s power\\r\\nwas unleashed. His armour instantly gave way.\\r\\nThe Monado doesn\\'t work on Metal Face\\r\\nat the moment, but if that vision comes true...\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nA tower? Doesn\\'t give us much to go on.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nCan you remember anything else from your vision?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI remember a huge horn.\\r\\nThat\\'s it! As I fought Metal Face,\\r\\nI could see the Bionis\\' head.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nPrison Island.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nPrison Island?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nI\\'ve never been.\\r\\nBut I\\'ve heard of a black tower\\r\\nat the head of the Bionis.\\r\\nThey say it was built by the ancient High Entia race.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThe High Entia are real?\\r\\nI thought they were a myth!\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nI wouldn\\'t blame you, son.\\r\\nAn ancient race living at the top of the Bionis?\\r\\nIt does sound crazy. But Bionis is home to all kinds of\\r\\ndifferent people, not just us. That includes the High Entia.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nThe High Entia? I\\'d dismissed them as folklore as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nNever assume anything.\\r\\nSeeing is believing, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nHave you ever met one?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nWell, yeah.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWow! Dickson, man, you\\'re just full of surprises!\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nWhat can I say? I\\'m well travelled.\\r\\nAnd it\\'s all for your future. Day and night\\r\\nI\\'ve searched for new lands, met new cultures\\r\\nand gained knowledge for our people.\\r\\nThe life of a wandering old fool.\\r\\nA lonely one at that.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban chuckles.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nStop your whining.\\r\\nYou do it \\'cos you enjoy it.\\r\\nAnd you make a tidy profit.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nWho asked you, Dunban?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWell then, Shulk, what\\'s it to be?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWe\\'ll head there.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nThere are alternatives. We could abandon\\r\\nthe colonies, find a place the Mechon will not\\r\\ndiscover and live in secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI realised something when we were fighting Xord. Wherever\\r\\nwe go, they\\'ll follow. We can\\'t run from these things.\\r\\nWe must fight on.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI see. Then I am obliged to join you.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou want to come with us?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nScared I\\'ll get hurt?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNo way! We know you\\'re stronger than anything!\\r\\nRight, Reyn?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou bet!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI\\'ve recovered a great deal since we last met.\\r\\nAnd that miserly old coot over there made me this.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sheathed on Dunban\\'s belt is the Anti-Mechon Glaive.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nSharp, light. Perfect for cutting through steel.\\r\\nShow me a Mechon and I\\'ll slice it in two.\\r\\nI might not be in peak condition, but I\\'m useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI can\\'t thank you enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWe\\'re in it together now.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou can count on us, Dunban.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nMiserly old coot? That sword is forged from\\r\\nMechon armour. It\\'s worth every penny.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nSo you keep saying...\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nIf you wanna go to the Bionis\\' head, you\\'ll\\r\\nneed a guide to get to the upper regions.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWe\\'re at the bottom, so I guess\\r\\nthe only way to go is up.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nRight.\\r\\nBut we\\'ll need to go up\\r\\nthe lower back first.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThe lower back...\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nColony 6 is right at the\\r\\ntop of the Bionis\\' leg.\\r\\nSo we\\'ll have to head around the waist.\\r\\nThrough a place called Satorl Marsh.\\r\\nFollow me.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The group accompany Dickson down the Freight Road to the Misty Path and into \\r\\nSatorl Marsh.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Bionis area intro: Satorl Marsh]\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party arrive in Satorl Marsh at the Kelsher Wetland and can see the trees \\r\\nlit up in an eerie bioluminescent glow at night.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI\\'ve never seen anywhere like this!\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nY\\'see?

I\\'ve never thought about going inside the Bionis.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nThe closer we get to the top, the more\\r\\nmonster trouble we\\'re gonna run into.\\r\\nThe only things that venture this far in are the\\r\\nNopon Merchants and curious types like me.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou really know all the fun spots, eh, Dickson?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nYou wanna get to the top?\\r\\nThen this is the only way.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWe\\'ll push on.

But just hold on a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWhat is it, Shulk?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s about the Monado. I\\'d like to ask\\r\\nyour permission to use it a little longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWhy ask me?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThe Monado was your sword.\\r\\nBut...I need it to achieve my goal.

This Prison Island Shulk\\r\\nsaw in his vision isn\\'t getting any closer.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Through the back of the ruins, the party find themselves in an organic region,\\r\\ninside the Terminal Trachea in the Bionis\\' Interior.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat is this place?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIt\\'s giving me the creeps.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAt a guess, I\\'d say we\\'re inside the Bionis.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk makes a noise of realisation.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWhat is it, Shulk?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNothing.\\r\\nIt\\'s just that...

Why is she here alone?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nAin\\'t got a clue. Ask her yourself.\\r\\nI\\'m not good with her posh accent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia begins leading the way, and the others fall in line behind her. She \\r\\npauses to address the group.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nWe shall travel to the Nopon village.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNopon village?! That\\'s where we\\'ve been heading.\\r\\nWe reckon it\\'s our best chance of making it to the top.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nSince inhabiting the region, the Nopon have been a\\r\\ngreat help. You can travel to Eryth Sea from their village.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s settled. We\\'ll make our way to the Nopon village.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nVery well. The Nopon inhabit a giant tree.\\r\\nIf we follow this trail, we will be safe.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia leads the party to the Village Entrance.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThis is the entrance to Frontier Village.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nSo this big tree is where the Nopon live?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia walks up to the Nopon guarding the entrance, the others following.]\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nAh! Bird Lady!\\r\\nWelcome back Bird Lady!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI wish to speak with the village chief.\\r\\nWill you permit us to enter?\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Nopon moves to one side.]\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nMy pleasure, my pleasure!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia walks past him, then turns around to address the group.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI shall take you to the village chief. Follow me.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party enter the village behind Melia.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Bionis area intro: Frontier Village]\\r\\n\\r\\n[The entire village is constructed inside the enormous tree, with Nopon homes \\r\\nsituated on various levels up the tree. The party walk into Frontier Village\\'s \\r\\nCentral Plaza to be greeted by a gathering of Nopon residents. ]\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHom Hom!\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHom here Hom here!\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHom who Hom who?\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHom Hom everywhere!\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nMe want touch Hom Hom!\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nMe want nibble Hom Hom!\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHom Hom taste!\\r\\n\\r\\n[This Nopon makes a spitting noise.]\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHom Hom scary!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia steps forward to address the villagers.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nNopon of Frontier Village!\\r\\nMelia Antiqua has returned. I request an audience with\\r\\nyour chief. Chief, will you hear my request?\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nMelia here.\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nBird Lady here.\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nMelia back.\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nBird Lady back.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk [inwardly]\\r\\nBird Lady?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Chief Dunga enters.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nMy dear Melia, it\\'s good to\\r\\nsee you again so soon.\\r\\nAnd you look so well.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia nods in response.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nAnd what of your men?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThey are at one with the Bionis. They\\r\\nsacrificed their lives so that I might escape.\\r\\nBut this is not my reason for coming.\\r\\nThese Homs need your help. Will you be\\r\\nso kind as to listen to their request?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nWhat could a Hom Hom need of me?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThey require safe passage to Eryth Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nI see no reason to deny them.\\r\\nAnd Melia, what of you?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI have unfinished business in this region.\\r\\nOnce these Homs are safely on their way,\\r\\nI shall be on mine as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia walks off on her own.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThat girl...something\\'s troubling her.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWe found her half-dead and all alone. But I don\\'t\\r\\nsuppose she\\'ll tell us the reason any time soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMaybe we can help.\\r\\nI\\'ll go and talk to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and the others find Melia alone on a balcony high atop the village, \\r\\nlooking out over Makna Forest.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMelia. You\\'re welcome to come with us.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia hangs her head.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIs it true? Were you alone in the forest?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThat thing must be stopped by my hand.\\r\\nThis is my pledge to those that have died.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis [V.O.]\\r\\nIs it wounded? I see... The Telethia is hurt\\r\\nand lies in rest. Wounded by a girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWounded by a girl... You don\\'t mean\\r\\nyou\\'re going to fight the Telethia?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia turns on Shulk and inhales sharply.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nHow do you know of the Telethia?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhen I went to collect the ether crystals,\\r\\nsome Telethia attacked me.\\r\\nI managed to destroy them and get away.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nYou defeated Telethia?! Who are you?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk explains it to her.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThe Monado... So that sword can...\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nTo tell the truth, they were the Telethia\\'s spawn.\\r\\nSomeone told me the primary Telethia is healing\\r\\nsomewhere in the forest.\\r\\nIt was you, wasn\\'t it?\\r\\nYou hurt the Telethia.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia begins to speak but stops.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMelia?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThe Telethia escaped from our homeland,\\r\\nand I am tasked with killing it.\\r\\nIt cannot remain free. For the sake of my people,\\r\\nand the Nopon, it must be stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMelia, we can help you defeat it, if you like.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nOut of pity?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNo.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nWhy, then?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s just... I...I want...\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nSpeak, Shulk. Or I shall be forced to summon\\r\\nthe Nopon chief to interpret for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI would like to help.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nWhat could you possibly gain\\r\\nfrom aiding me?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI saw it. At the top of a black tower, you and I were\\r\\nfighting together. Fighting that faced Mechon.\\r\\nI also saw you fighting a huge Telethia.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIt threw me the first time \\'n\\' all.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nForgive me, Shulk, but what are you talking about?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk can see visions of the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nSee the future?! And you expect\\r\\nme to believe this rubbish?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nBelieve what you want, lady.\\r\\nSame as I tell all the non-believers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThat\\'ll be me then.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nOh yeah.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn turns back to Melia.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIn any case, the only reason we got\\r\\nthis far was \\'cos of Shulk\\'s visions.\\r\\nIf Shulk says he saw you in a vision, then you\\r\\nmust be important to whatever happens next.\\r\\nAnd if you\\'re tough enough to fight a faced Mechon,\\r\\nyou\\'re all right in my book.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou\\'ve got my vote. A lady should not go\\r\\nunaccompanied onto the battlefield.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nExcuse me! I am quite capable of dispatching\\r\\nthe beast alone! I require no assistance of any kind!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Chief Dunga wanders over.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nMy dear. I apologise, but I could\\r\\nnot help overhearing.\\r\\nTheir offer sounds quite reasonable.\\r\\nThe danger extends much further than our\\r\\nsmall dwelling. Makna itself is at risk.\\r\\nAnd we shall provide you with\\r\\nthe finest warrior of our clan.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nChief Dunga, I...\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nNo need for thanks. He is the equal,\\r\\nif not better, of the Hom Hom.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou do know we\\'re listening?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nThe chosen Nopon hero will await you below.\\r\\nI shall go ahead and prepare him. Please excuse me.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn [scoffing]\\r\\nA Nopon hero?\\r\\nNow this I have to see!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDon\\'t be like that. Let\\'s meet him first.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party gather back at Central Plaza at the bottom of Frontier Village.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nMay I introduce...\\r\\nHeropon Riki!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view shifts towards the top of the village. Many Nopon are gathered around\\r\\nthe village too.]\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nYay! Riki! Our Heropon!\\r\\n\\r\\n[A Nopon then drops from an upper level, his body smacking into Reyn\\'s face, \\r\\nand then he\\'s awkwardly volleyed about by the other party members.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWatch out!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nGet off me!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nTo you!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia bats him over to Shulk, who sends the Heropon back into the air flipping\\r\\nend over end.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nRight in the... Take this, furball!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn proceeds to spike Riki into the ground as the other party members \\r\\nwince. Shulk, Melia, Sharla and Dunban lean in for a closer look at their new \\r\\ncompanion. Riki hangs from the bridge over the water. His fellow villagers \\r\\nbegin pelting him with mushrooms to spur him into action. The party begin \\r\\nshielding themselves from this onslaught and look increasingly hopeless.]\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHeropon!\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHeropon fight back!\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHeropon chomp chomp!\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHeropon go forth!\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHeropon get up!\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHeropon make Nopon proud!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nSilence!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Nopon quieten down and stop throwing things. Dunga goes over and lifts up\\r\\nRiki by the hand.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nI introduce to you\\r\\nthis year\\'s legendary Heropon,\\r\\nRiki!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Riki is held up by Dunga for all to see, but there are X\\'s in his eyes and the\\r\\nHeropon is still clearly dazed from his soon-to-be companions\\' actions. The \\r\\nother five look on uncertainly. Once Riki comes to, he quickly leaps out of \\r\\nDunga\\'s grasp and greets the party.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nNew Hom Hom friends!\\r\\nMeet this year\\'s legendary Heropon, Riki!\\r\\nRiki live to serve!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Riki then executes an adorable winking salute. The party still appear to need\\r\\nsome convincing, however.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nA Heropon, you say? Not sure where you\\'ll\\r\\ncome in handy, but the more the merrier.\\r\\nShulk, are these Telethia as strong as they sound?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYes.\\r\\nThey\\'re quick as lightning and can read your mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nA mind-reading giant bird. No problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI can see their movement through the Monado, but even\\r\\nthat\\'s not enough to get the better of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAnd we\\'re going up against the daddy version.\\r\\nNo one blink for a second.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nOK.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nEyes wide open!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAnd don\\'t forget that Melia is our only chance of making it to\\r\\nEryth Sea. If anything happens to our guide, it\\'s on our heads.\\r\\nThe Telethia is our target, but don\\'t forget\\r\\nabout the person standing next to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nDunban\\'s right.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI am in your debt.\\r\\nMy weaknesses are all too apparent.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNo worries, Melia!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nRiki has been informed of the Dinobeast,\\r\\nwhat you refer to as the Telethia.\\r\\nBe safe, my Hom Hom friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki\\'s friends, listen to Riki!\\r\\nDinobeast is big and scary!\\r\\nFriends get ready, friends help Riki get ready!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou want us to get equipment for you?\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki\\'s friend right.\\r\\nHom Hom clever!\\r\\nFriends meet Riki when ready.\\r\\nThen friends and Riki leave together.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nBig attitude for a furry footrest.\\r\\n\"Dinobeast is big and scary!\"\\r\\nGreat. That\\'ll come in handy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nIs it just me or did we suddenly\\r\\nbecome Nopon mercenaries?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Nevertheless, the party collect Riki\\'s weapon from the Weapon Shop as well as \\r\\nRiki\\'s armour from the Armour Shop. Once they have all of the Heropon\\'s \\r\\nequipment, they meet their new friend back at Central Plaza.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nReady to go! Come new friends,\\r\\nRiki\\'s adventure begins!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nRiki? You do know where\\r\\nthe Telethia is, don\\'t you?\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nOf course Riki know!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Riki turns to Melia.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nMelly! Riki hear you hurt Dinobeast!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI did. But only a little.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nWhen Dinobeast hurt, Riki know\\r\\nit go to place with ether crystals.\\r\\nFriends and Riki go to place with\\r\\ncrystals. Then we find Dinobeast!\\r\\nChief tell Riki! Chief always right!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nSo you do know a thing or two about this monster.\\r\\nGuess we\\'ll be searching for some ether crystals then.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party begin to depart. Once they reach the Nopon Tower, Shulk stops Riki.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nRiki? Why are you the Heropon?\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nWhy? Because Chief Dunga choose Riki!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nHe chose you? So you weren\\'t\\r\\nchosen from birth?\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nFriend wrong. Chief choose by instinct!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nBy instinct?!\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nWhy friend surprised? Chief have\\r\\nsharp instinct. Chief be village seer!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nSo that\\'s how you became the Heropon?\\r\\nCan\\'t argue with that.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nBut he is kind of...compact...for a warrior hero.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Riki sighs.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki owe lots of monies to village.\\r\\nIf Riki defeat Dinobeast, village\\r\\npromise to forget my debts.\\r\\nSo Riki like being Heropon!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Riki leads the party to the Decayed Forest in Makna. This part of the forest \\r\\nis a blighted wasteland.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nWhat is this? Riki never see before!\\r\\nThis not Riki\\'s Makna!\\r\\nRiki never see before!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nTo think it has caused this much damage.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nWhat do you mean?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAre you telling me the Telethia did this?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nTelethia absorb and drain the\\r\\nsurrounding area of all its ether.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThat\\'s it!\\r\\nThe Telethia is sucking up all the ether, which is\\r\\ncausing the natural environment to change.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nShulk, the Telethia can read your mind.\\r\\nExpect it to know what you will do before you do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI know.\\r\\nI\\'ll aim for its antenna and stop\\r\\nits ability to read my thoughts.\\r\\nWith the Monado at our side,\\r\\nit doesn\\'t stand a chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nIt is much more powerful than its offspring.\\r\\nDo not expect it to fall so easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI won\\'t. But we have to trust in the Monado.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia [inwardly]\\r\\nShulk has only met Telethia once,\\r\\nand they were merely the spawn.\\r\\nSo why is he so sure of himself?\\r\\nIs it confidence or a trust in something?\\r\\nYes. It is trust. He trusts in\\r\\nthe power of that sword.\\r\\nWhat did he say it was called?\\r\\nThe Monado? I see...\\r\\n\\r\\n[The group walk across the withered grass but are interrupted by a Telethia\\'s \\r\\nroar. The Leone Telethia bursts in suddenly, causing Shulk to duck.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nStick together everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nDinobeast!\\r\\nBig as Riki imagined!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Telethia roars again as Shulk activates the Monado.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThe Telethia!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia steps forward, in front of the group.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI take this chance to bring\\r\\nvengeance for my brethren\\r\\nand fulfil my duty!\\r\\nShulk! I will trap it and cease its movement.\\r\\nStrike when the time is right!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia rushes towards the beast.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMelia!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk runs after her. Melia activates ether from her staff and flings it at \\r\\nthe Telethia.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nBe still!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The light strikes the Telethia, holding it in place. The others rush in.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nOh yeah! She\\'s nifty with that staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nI knew it.\\r\\nShe can control ether energy without\\r\\nusing catalysts or rifle shells.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI\\'ve heard that such people exist.\\r\\nBut I never thought she would be one.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The group stand next to Melia, who then runs towards their quarry.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nShulk, Reyn, Sharla!\\r\\nProtect Melia at all costs!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nOn it!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nRight!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk charges towards the monster last of all, the Monado blazing with light.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[At the end of the ensuing battle, Sharla hits the Leone Telethia with rifle \\r\\nshots while Dunban strikes it with his sword, severing an appendage. Riki \\r\\nlaughs victoriously as Dunban lands. But a moment later, the Telethia \\r\\nregenerates the appendage in a burst of green light.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWhat the?!\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nDinobeast grown back thing!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou\\'ve got to be kidding me!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Telethia roars, fully rejuvenated.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nIt\\'s no good.\\r\\nMy ether shots are having no effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIts regenerative power is too much!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia steps up past the group.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nIt is all right, Shulk.\\r\\nDestroying the Telethia is beyond us!\\r\\nWe should cut our losses and\\r\\nmourn those who perished.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNever, Melia!\\r\\nThe men you lost...\\r\\nI can tell they were dear to you.\\r\\nI know only too well that desire for revenge.\\r\\nAnd the crushing pain of\\r\\nlosing those close to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Momentary flashback to Metal Face in Colony 9.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI can\\'t stand by and let another person\\r\\nexperience what I have.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Monado\\'s glow now changes from blue to green.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThis monster is going down!\\r\\nI\\'ll trap him with the Monado!\\r\\nThen the rest of you, hit the Telethia\\r\\nwith everything you have!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReady?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia nods her readiness.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Near the end of this next battle, the Telethia begins to go berserk, causing \\r\\nRiki to scamper away in fright.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nRiki!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Telethia\\'s tail strikes Riki, sending him crashing to the ground,\\r\\nmoaning. The monster rushes in to finish him off, but Shulk stops it with green\\r\\nlight pouring from the Monado. The others dash in.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nNow! Dunban!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nBite on this!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban leaps and stabs one of its heads, while Reyn stabs a leg. Dunban \\r\\nstruggles to hold on while the beast flips its head about.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNow, Melia!\\r\\nFinish him!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia powers up her staff with brilliant light, then strikes the ground, the \\r\\nlight covering the Telethia completely. The sphere of light then collapses \\r\\ninwards, and when it\\'s gone, so is the Telethia. The party regroup afterwards.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nBrilliant thinking.\\r\\nEven though the Telethia can absorb large amounts of\\r\\nether energy and regenerate at an incredible rate...\\r\\nAbsorbing so much energy caused it to implode.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWho would have thought? Brute force wins\\r\\nagain. Nothing like an old-fashioned scrap.\\r\\nDickson would have been proud.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt was the only way I could think of.\\r\\nIf there had been another way...\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nDon\\'t listen to Dunban. Soon you and\\r\\nthat Monado will be unstoppable.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s like at Tephra Cave.\\r\\nIt was almost natural, instinctive. The Monado\\r\\nresponded to me, and I harnessed a new power.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou\\'ll get your chance, Shulk.\\r\\nWe\\'ll turn that faced Mechon into scrap.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI know. That\\'s what keeps me going.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nHogard, Garan, Damil, Aizel. Are you there?\\r\\nI did it. It\\'s dead. Did you see?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia turns back to the group.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI thank you for your aid in my cause.\\r\\nJustice has been served.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou\\'re welcome. Besides, it was mostly you.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Riki revives.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nDinobeast!\\r\\nHeropon Riki ready for round two!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Riki looks around at the others, who look back at him.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nHey! Fight over already?\\r\\nNo! Riki not know!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI\\'m afraid it\\'s all finished.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWe couldn\\'t have done it without\\r\\nyou, brave little Heropon!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn snorts with laughter.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki brave!\\r\\nReyn also a little brave.\\r\\nRiki happy happy!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later, back at Frontier Village, there is celebration.]\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHeropon Riki be proud!\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHeropon Riki tough guy!\\r\\n\\r\\nNopon\\r\\nHeropon Riki bestest!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nLook at him.

Your debts are repaid.\\r\\nHowever, while you were gone, your littlepons ate like\\r\\nravenous Orluga. It set Chief Dunga back quite a bit.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Chief Dunga turns to the rest of the village.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nNopon of Frontier Village!\\r\\nA new prophecy has been told!\\r\\nOur Heropon, slayer of Dinobeast, will further his legend\\r\\nby accompanying the Hom Hom on their travels!\\r\\nAnd bringing peace to the lands of Bionis!\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki never hear this!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nIt was prophecised many years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nChief lying!

Oka borrow monies\\r\\nfor littlepons\\' food.\\r\\nChief Dunga know best! Riki must\\r\\nwork for littlepons to have good life.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki will! OK, Oka.\\r\\nRiki happy to join friends!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nReyn happy too! Come on, furball.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Chief Dunga then turns to Melia.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nNow you can return with your head held high, my dear.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nIndeed. Thank you, Dunga.\\r\\nMy thanks for your gracious help.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nNot at all! Peace has been restored to the\\r\\nMakna region. On behalf of all Nopon, thank you!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nChief Dunga is very fond of Melia.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nSame Hom Hom, different world.\\r\\nNot fair if you ask me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nChief Dunga.\\r\\nWill you kindly grant these Homs passage\\r\\nto Eryth Sea? It is my promise to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunga\\r\\nWithout question! These Hom Hom\\r\\nfought valiantly in aid of our village.\\r\\nAnd a request by you, my dear,\\r\\ncannot go unanswered.\\r\\nI shall inform the villagers at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nYou are too kind.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia comes over to the others.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThe Chief has spoken.\\r\\nYou should depart for Eryth Sea at once.\\r\\nPrepare your things and see me when you are ready.\\r\\n\\r\\n[After these preparations are made, the party meet Melia at the top level of \\r\\nthe village, across from the Mysterious Sanctuary.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMelia. What will you do now?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI would like to repay you for your help.\\r\\nPermit me to act as your guide to Eryth Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nOf course! We\\'d love you to.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nBut I must warn you. Eryth Sea is vast.\\r\\nDo you know where you wish to go?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThere\\'s a dark tower at the head of the Bionis.\\r\\nI saw it in a vision.\\r\\nThat\\'s where I must go.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nA dark tower? Then we\\r\\nneed not search at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSo you\\'ve heard of it?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nHeard of it? I have seen it.\\r\\nA dark tower at the head of the Bionis.\\r\\nOnly one place fits that description.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nSo you know it?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI believe what you saw was Prison Island.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nPrison Island. Dickson said the same thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nIndeed. Melia, have you ever been there?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI have not set foot upon the island, but I know of it.\\r\\nPrison Island is sealed. No one may\\r\\nenter without imperial sanction.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nImperial sanction? That means we\\'ll be\\r\\nneeding someone to grant us entry.\\r\\nI\\'ve heard that Eryth Sea is home to an empire ruled\\r\\nby the High Entia. They might be our best chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nYou are knowledgable for a Homs.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nSanctions, empires?\\r\\nAnyone help here?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nA sanction is permission from someone important.\\r\\nAn empire must be a place ruled by an Emperor. In other\\r\\nwords, we need an Emperor\\'s permission to enter the island.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThis Emperor... Is he important?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nLong before we Homs built the colonies...\\r\\nA group of so-called royal-types or\\r\\nimperials ruled our lands.\\r\\nThink of them like the heads of our colony.\\r\\nBut with much greater influence and power.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nNow I get it. Dunban knows\\r\\nmore than a textbook!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nAre you kidding? That\\'s first year\\r\\nHoms history, Reyn!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI might have slept through that class...\\r\\nSo when do we get to meet\\r\\nthese High Entia folks?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nYou are so... Forget it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nFirst we must travel to the imperial capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWe\\'ll see how easy it is\\r\\nto see this Emperor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nMy promise was to be your guide.\\r\\nI will not break it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia begins walking ahead.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMelia, isn\\'t that the...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia pauses at a rope bridge leading up.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThe shortcut to Eryth Sea, yes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia and Riki lead the party to Apex Lake at the top of Frontier Village. \\r\\nAfter speaking to the Transport Guide at Contemplation Terrace in front of the \\r\\nlake and agreeing to be taken to Eryth Sea, the group walk to the lake\\'s edge.\\r\\nThere, a column of light forms in front of them, stretching all the way up to \\r\\nthe water-filled sky. There is a ball of light at the base of this column.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat is it?!\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nFriends, jump in ball!\\r\\nAll go to Eryth!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nJump? In that?\\r\\nYou\\'re nuts, furball!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nYou have nothing to fear.\\r\\nThis will take us to Eryth Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia walks into the ball of light, followed by Riki, then Shulk, Dunban and \\r\\nSharla, leaving Reyn all alone. After much hesitation, he goes in after them. \\r\\nThe ball of light then travels upwards.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Meanwhile in a dark laboratory, a High Entia woman studies a Telethia behind \\r\\na glass case that appears to be in hibernation.]\\r\\n\\r\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nCHAPTER 8\\r\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n[Bionis area intro: Eryth Sea]\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party find themselves at Latael Shore on Eryth Sea. A vast sea lies before\\r\\nthe group, with islands and reefs floating high above.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWho would\\'ve thought Eryth Sea\\r\\nwas right on top of Riki\\'s village.\\r\\nDive deep enough, you can reach their tree!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sharla puts a palm to her face.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nPerhaps you should try?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nMight do. Haven\\'t decided yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia looks at Shulk.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nIs something wrong?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nAren\\'t you curious... About why we\\'re\\r\\ngoing to Prison Island, I mean?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nIt is not common for Homs\\r\\nto visit this region.\\r\\nYou may have good reason, but forgive me.\\r\\nI do not pry into other people\\'s business.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIt\\'s definitely bugging her, Shulk.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nHow dare you! You clown!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s OK, Melia. We\\'re not strangers anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nWell, I... You are right.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSo then you\\'ll listen to our story?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia hesitates; Reyn nods at her.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nYes. Tell me why you are here.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nBasically, it all started when...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk proceeds to tell her the whole story.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI see. I had heard about the Mechon\\r\\nassault on the lower regions, but did\\r\\nnot know the situation was so grave.\\r\\nHow lucky we are...\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nHey, what\\'s that?\\r\\n\\r\\n[The group look up to see a dark tower floating above Eryth Sea.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIs that...?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nYou are looking at Prison Island.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSo that\\'s Prison Island...\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nYes. And that is the imperial capital, Alcamoth.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The group turn to see a large bright city of floating pods and spires opposite\\r\\nPrison Island.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIt\\'s not just me, right?\\r\\nA floating city is a bit weird?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nBuilt with superior defences in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIncredible. What technology\\r\\nmakes this possible?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI do not know. And I have\\r\\nnever had the need to.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou don\\'t know?\\r\\nIt doesn\\'t freak you out?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou can eat bread without knowing\\r\\nhow to bake it. Makes sense to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nYou will need imperial sanction to enter Prison Island.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nOK.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nWe will travel to the capital first.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nAnd how do you expect us\\r\\nto get up there? Fly?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThere is a transporter up ahead.\\r\\nWe can use that.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view momentarily shifts to this transporter before returning to the party \\r\\non the shore.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWe\\'ve been deep sea diving, now we\\'re gonna fly?\\r\\nThis place gives me the creeps.\\r\\nBut I guess we don\\'t have a choice.\\r\\nRight, onwards to the capital!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nStill...\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat is it, Dunban?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nIt\\'s a sight to behold.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view shifts to some automated craft flying near the capital.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nThose look like anti-Mechon\\r\\ndefence systems.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Eventually, as the party arrive at the Centre Gate, which will take them into\\r\\nAlcamoth, a group of High Entia Imperial Guards emerge from the transporter.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWho are these guys?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nAre those wings on their head?!\\r\\nThey must be High Entia!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The guards kneel.]\\r\\n\\r\\nImperial Guard\\r\\nWelcome home, Lady Melia.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nLady?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nHuh.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia walks up to the guards.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThank you, Captain.\\r\\nThese Homs and this Nopon are my guests.\\r\\nSee them safely to the guest quarters.\\r\\nGive them anything they need.\\r\\n\\r\\nImperial Guard\\r\\nAs you wish.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat\\'s going on?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nI have no idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMelia, are you...?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Just then, Shulk receives a vision: Melia, wearing a ceremonial mask, is \\r\\nkneeling in a strange room alone.

My \\'sight\\' is hindered.\\r\\nHowever...\\r\\n\\r\\nSorean\\r\\nSpeak, Seer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nIt is not certain that the Monado\\r\\nwill bring about our destruction.\\r\\nWhile my sight is hindered, I have\\r\\nseen a sliver of light.\\r\\nIs Your Majesty not aware of this light as well?\\r\\n\\r\\nSorean\\r\\nAre you referring to Melia?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nAnd the young man, Shulk.\\r\\n\\r\\nSorean\\r\\nCould it be that the boy is trustworthy after all?\\r\\nKallian, we are on the cusp of a significant moment.\\r\\nThe investiture ceremony must\\r\\ntake place as soon as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nYour Majesty. Since the ministries are already in agreement,\\r\\nwe may be able to bypass some of the formalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSorean\\r\\nIndeed. But she must still earn the\\r\\nblessing of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nYumea\\r\\nMight I suggest the trial of the Tomb?\\r\\n\\r\\nSorean\\r\\nFirst Consort, such a ritual has not been\\r\\nconducted for generations.\\r\\n\\r\\nYumea\\r\\nWe have simply not had a need for it until now.\\r\\nAnd I feel that she is more than equal to the challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nMother, the Tomb is dangerous.\\r\\nOur records show that many potential successors\\r\\nlost their lives performing the ritual.\\r\\n\\r\\nYumea\\r\\nThat child fought and beat the Telethia. It is my\\r\\nbelief that she is more than strong enough.\\r\\nBesides, if it was revealed that she\\r\\navoided such a responsibility,\\r\\nher reputation among the people\\r\\nwould be irreparably damaged.\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nI must protest!\\r\\n\\r\\nSorean\\r\\nNo, no, no... The First Consort is right.\\r\\nThere is much risk, but the rewards are greater.\\r\\nIt would seal the people\\'s love for her.\\r\\nSummon Melia. Her thoughts must be heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later, Melia appears kneeling before the Emperor.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI accept.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia looks up at the Emperor, the prince and the First Consort.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nIf I am to lead the High Entia\\r\\ndespite my mixed heritage...\\r\\nIf I am to succeed the throne, then\\r\\nI accept what must be done.\\r\\n\\r\\nSorean\\r\\nI expect nothing less of my successor.\\r\\nThe path to greatness is fraught with danger.\\r\\nThis shall be your statement to Bionis.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nYes, Your Majesty.\\r\\n\\r\\nYumea [inwardly]\\r\\nYou are not fit to be Empress. Not now, not ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Alvis looks significantly at Yumea.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Elsewhere, at the Ether Crystal Deposit on Eryth Sea, Shulk and his companions\\r\\nhave completed their quest and saved the worker who was attacked by Kromars.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nLooks like we got them out of a scrape!\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nShulk!

But that is for another time.\\r\\nMy ancestry is not easily explained.\\r\\nAnd my ability to see the future\\r\\nis equally complicated.\\r\\nYou might say I have my own ritual.\\r\\nIs it not the same for you?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNo. My visions appear suddenly,\\r\\nwithout warning.\\r\\nAt first, they\\'re obscure. Then as it gets closer\\r\\nto the event, I start to understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nIt seems you possess\\r\\na power greater than I.\\r\\nI still have not seen any danger\\r\\nbefall Her Highness.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nNot much use as a seer then, are you?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nNothing passes you by, does it?\\r\\nNow you see why I asked for your help.

It is compelled\\r\\nto do its master\\'s bidding.\\r\\nMagnified greatly, it has the power to control\\r\\nthe very fabric of our world - ether.\\r\\nControl the ether and your will is made reality.\\r\\nI willed it, and it happened. That is all.\\r\\nPerhaps due to that power, the High Entia\\r\\nsealed away the Monado for centuries.\\r\\nEventually, it found its way into the hands of\\r\\nthe Homs, and then you, Shulk.\\r\\nA coincidence or something more?\\r\\nYou must discover this yourself.\\r\\nFor you are the one who wields the Monado.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Alvis turns towards the Tomb.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nThe Bionis is stirring.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The door to the Tomb dematerialises, and the group enter.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Meanwhile, Melia is already inside the Tomb, ahead of Shulk\\'s party.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia [inwardly]\\r\\nThe ancestral altar lies deep beneath the seals.\\r\\nWhat trials await me, I wonder?\\r\\nI must not lose focus!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia arrives before the door to the Sealed Chamber and activates the \\r\\nVerification Device.

Why would Father go there?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia thinks for a moment, then comes to a decision.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nNo!\\r\\nI must go to the palace.\\r\\nI must stop him.

Where is Father?\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nMelia...\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThe Imperial Staff, it\\'s... So Father has gone?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Kallian tries to speak but can\\'t find the words.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nKallian!\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nThe Emperor has proceeded to the island, alone.\\r\\nFor the sake of the empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nWhy did you let him go alone? Father...!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis [O.C.]\\r\\nHis Majesty is fully aware.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nAlvis...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Alvis strides into the Audience Chamber.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nOf what will happen to him,\\r\\nand what he must do before then.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou saw something?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nI did. During our ancient divination ritual.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIf he knows, then why?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nBecause he is the ruler of the imperial family\\r\\nand all the High Entia.\\r\\nWe must respect his decision above all else.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nBut that doesn\\'t mean...\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nTrust him, Shulk. His fate was decided long ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nNo!\\r\\n\\r\\n[There is a brief silence, then...]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nShulk, we\\'re going!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDunban?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nRespect? Destiny?\\r\\nWe don\\'t need rules to tell us when to\\r\\nsave the people we care for!\\r\\nYou too, Melia.\\r\\nDon\\'t give up on him.\\r\\nThe Emperor, your father, is going to die!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nDunban!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nThere\\'s only one thing to do.\\r\\nAre you with me?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nOf course!\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nBut you can\\'t!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWe are Homs.

Meanwhile, in the skies above Eryth Sea, the \\r\\nbattle rages on.

But first we must unlock the seals.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSeals?\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view shifts to Central Seal Island.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nWe\\'ll need to unlock two seals to reach Prison Island.\\r\\nThen a door will appear before us, showing the way.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view returns to the Centre Gate.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nGot it. Move, everyone!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The group proceed to open the sister gates, Khatorl and Soltnar, and from \\r\\nCentral Seal Island unlock the transporter\\'s seal that will lead them to their \\r\\ndestination.

Dinobeast!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The others follow Riki to a large statue of what appears to be a Telethia.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIt\\'s just a statue. Don\\'t freak us out like that, Riki!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nIs this a person?

I\\'ve seen this\\r\\nthing somewhere before...\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nDinobeast! Dinobeast!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou might be right.\\r\\nIt reminds me of the Telethia as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDid your ancestors build this island?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nNo. The stories tell of this place\\r\\nexisting long before my people.\\r\\nNo one knows for sure, but we think our\\r\\nforefathers are the ones who sealed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nI wonder what\\'s hidden inside.\\r\\nWell, we\\'ll know soon enough, I suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThere! An engraving by the forefathers.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The group turn to find the engraving with ancient symbols that Melia has \\r\\npointed out.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI\\'ve seen this engraving around the capital.\\r\\nMany researchers have tried and failed\\r\\nto discover its meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHey, Shulk. That symbol.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah... It\\'s similar to the Monado\\'s symbols.\\r\\nThere must be a connection.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nConnection?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThe sealed door of Prison Island.\\r\\nIt is said that only a true successor\\r\\nto the throne can open it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThen the Emperor must be inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI believe so.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia calls out in an amplified voice.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nForefathers.\\r\\nI, your descendant Melia Antiqua, stand before you.\\r\\nFor the sake of our world, release the seal!\\r\\n\\r\\n[A green disc-shaped light scans Melia\\'s body, like a similar instance in the \\r\\nHigh Entia Tomb.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nJust like at the Tomb...\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat\\'s it doing?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nAren\\'t we going to help?!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nPlease do not worry. It is necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The massive door opens, revealing the grim Central Hall beyond.

OK.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Bionis area intro: Prison Island]\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Central Hall is lined with torches lit by eerie blue flames. There is also\\r\\nblack fog that serves as a transporter.

But I thought our\\r\\nforefathers imprisoned you here?!\\r\\n\\r\\nZanza\\r\\nI forged the Monado. It is moulded from me.\\r\\nAll who wield the sword are made known to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou made the Monado?!\\r\\n\\r\\nZanza\\r\\nYes.\\r\\nI made it millennia ago to oppose Mechonis.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nBut why are you imprisoned?\\r\\n\\r\\nZanza\\r\\nThe Monado controls the principle upon which life\\r\\nis based, the source of your existence - ether.\\r\\nMaster the principle of life and all things will bow to you.\\r\\nYour power would be infinite.\\r\\nAs you now know, the sword gives the\\r\\nwielder the power of foresight.\\r\\nAnd I myself once used that sword against\\r\\nthe Mechonis, and defeated it.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou\\'re telling us you beat the Mechonis\\r\\nwith that tiny thing?!\\r\\n\\r\\nZanza\\r\\nIts appearance is merely an illusion.\\r\\nIts form morphs to conform\\r\\nto the will of its master.\\r\\nThe power comes from within.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk inhales sharply.]\\r\\n\\r\\nZanza\\r\\nBut its power was feared by some.

I\\'ve been thinking about Fiora,\\r\\nand I can\\'t help wondering...\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWondering what?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou saw how Fiora acted. It was like\\r\\nshe didn\\'t even recognise us.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYes. It\\'s unsettling.\\r\\nBut Shulk, don\\'t get me wrong.

You and Fiora used to be inseparable.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI need to tell you something.\\r\\nI always thought, if Fiora were to be\\r\\nwith anyone, it should be you.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat? But Reyn hangs out\\r\\nwith her just as much as me.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYeah, he does.

It doesn\\'t matter that\\r\\nshe\\'s lost her memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah... I guess you\\'re right.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nFiora and I have spent our entire lives together.\\r\\nThe memory of that can\\'t have disappeared completely.\\r\\nIt\\'s up to us. We have to help her remember.\\r\\nHelp me, Shulk. Help me get her back!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou know I will.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nOK. Let\\'s go tell the others.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Dunban return to the others at Whitewing Palace.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHey, they\\'re back.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nHave you gathered your thoughts?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYes.

All thanks to Dunban.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI\\'m...glad.\\r\\n\\r\\n[An Imperial Guard enters the room.]\\r\\n\\r\\nImperial Guard\\r\\nForgive me, His Highness Kallian summons you.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk turns to the others.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou think something happened?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWe won\\'t know until we get there.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk\\'s party meet Kallian in the Audience Chamber.]\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nI apologise for calling you at short notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s fine.

You wouldn\\'t think twice otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI just don\\'t know.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia enters the room.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nFind her, Shulk.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMelia...I...\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI used to believe my father did not love me.\\r\\nUntil the day he died.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk is rendered speechless.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nIf you do not grasp the importance of loved ones\\r\\nuntil after they are gone...\\r\\nThat is simply too late.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou\\'re right, Melia.

I will remain here.\\r\\nWe must say goodbye.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nIs that what you really want?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nYes.\\r\\nBut promise me when you find her,\\r\\nyou\\'ll come back.\\r\\nI\\'ll be here waiting for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI don\\'t know what to say. Thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia escorts the party down to the capital\\'s exit.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s probably a good idea if I go and tell Kallian myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI am sure he already understands.\\r\\nBesides, it\\'s likely that the ministers are\\r\\nharrassing him at this present moment.\\r\\nWe should spare him any further inconvenience.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThen this is goodbye.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nYes. Come back as soon as you can.\\r\\nWe are in great need of your help.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nGot it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and the others leave, but Sharla stays behind, then goes to Melia.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nAhem...\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nWhy are you still here?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nListen. I\\'ll keep an eye on Shulk for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nWhatever can you mean?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nIt\\'s a risky strategy, letting Shulk go off\\r\\nand just hoping he\\'ll come back to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nShulk and I are merely...\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nYeah, yeah. But remember!

I am aware of everything.\\r\\nGo forth and follow your heart.\\r\\nThere will come a day when we need you,\\r\\nbut it is not today.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYour Highness, that means a lot to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThat is one cool prince.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nIf only someone had his sensitivity...\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nSensitivity? I\\'m sensitive...\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThe jury\\'s out on that one.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sharla walks over to Melia.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThat\\'s a relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia nods her agreement.]\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nWe have recently received a report that the\\r\\nsilver-faced Mechon fled to Galahad Fortress,\\r\\nthe Mechon stronghold at Sword Valley.\\r\\nIt will be a treacherous path.\\r\\nMy sister is in your hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThank you, Kallian.\\r\\nI will keep her safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nRegent, I accept your request.\\r\\nI will return victorious with Shulk.\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nI am most pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis [O.C.]\\r\\nLeaving without me?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Alvis walks over to the group.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDo you want to come?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nTo reach Galahad Fortress you will need to travel\\r\\nthrough Valak Mountain, on the right arm of the Bionis.\\r\\nThe snow-covered mountains are fraught with danger.\\r\\nThose unfamiliar to them risk never coming back.\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nOf course, you would be familiar with that region.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nThen there\\'s no point in wasting time.\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nLeave the allied force to me.\\r\\nI am not known for my diplomacy,\\r\\nbut call it pride. I shall succeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWe\\'ll join you as soon as we can.\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nI look forward to the day.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Kallian turns to the party as a whole.]\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nHeroes of Bionis! Make us proud!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Imperial Guards behind Kallian kneel.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou see. Now we\\'re getting some respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nWe\\'re back to this again, are we?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSee you soon, Kallian.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk\\'s party, led by Alvis, leave the imperial city through the Centre Gate.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nWe will need to traverse Sword Valley\\r\\nif we wish to reach Galahad Fortress.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nIf Colony 6 were in better shape, we could\\r\\nhave taken a pod from there.\\r\\nHow are we getting there?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nWe will take the path down from the Bionis\\' right arm.\\r\\nSword Valley is where the arm\\r\\nmeets the Mechonis\\' sword.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nSo that\\'s our route.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nAs I said earlier, it is a snow-covered mountain\\r\\nrange, and you should expect a tough climb.\\r\\nAre we all ready?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nReady as we\\'ll ever be!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nQuite.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Alvis sets off for a nearby pod.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nFirst, we will head through Makna Forest.\\r\\nThis short-range pod will be our transport.\\r\\nAll aboard, people.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party speak to the Captain to tell him they\\'re ready to depart in the \\r\\nvessel to Makna Forest. Moments later, the short-range pod takes off. From the \\r\\nPod Landing Site in Makna Forest, the group make their way through Valak Pass \\r\\nto the mountain beyond.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Meanwhile at Galahad Fortress, Face Nemesis undergoes repairs. Fiora is inside\\r\\nand continues to speak in a voice not her own.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nZanza is not dead.\\r\\nI feel it.\\r\\nOur tragedy unfolds once again.\\r\\n\\r\\nVanea [O.C.]\\r\\nLady Meyneth.\\r\\nDoes that mean...?\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nIndeed. I do not doubt\\r\\nthat Egil, too, is aware.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Flashback to Zanza, freed from his shackles at Prison Island.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nHowever, why free the Monado?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Flashback to Shulk, powering up the Monado at Prison Island.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nZanza must realise it is now\\r\\na double-edged sword.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Flashback to the ether particles that are all that remain of Zanza, and the \\r\\nspear that destroyed his shell. This is followed by another flashback of Shulk\\r\\nattacking the Mechon with the Monado.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nAnd what reason could he have\\r\\nfor choosing the boy?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Back to the present, Fiora seems momentarily confused. Her voice is still \\r\\nMeyneth\\'s, but a little bit of Fiora\\'s intonation can be heard.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nWhat is this?\\r\\nI am experiencing feelings for the boy?\\r\\n\\r\\nVanea\\r\\nLady Meyneth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nVanea.\\r\\nYour swift repairs are appreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nVanea\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nI wish to see that boy again.\\r\\nTo meet with the one\\r\\nwho wields the Monado.\\r\\n\\r\\nVanea\\r\\nThe boy?\\r\\nBut, my lady, is that not-\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nIs Egil aware of my reawakening?\\r\\n\\r\\nVanea\\r\\nHe is not.\\r\\nAs my Lady wished, he knows nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nThen there is no need to worry.\\r\\nI shall meet the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Face Nemesis\\' cockpit closes around Fiora. Inside, she touches a hand to the\\r\\nchest component on her armour. It activates with a red glow.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nBesides,\\r\\nthe Monado will draw him to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora activates the controls. Outside, Face Nemesis takes off high above \\r\\nGalahad Fortress, soaring across Sword Valley towards Bionis. Her departure is \\r\\nnoticed by Metal Face.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMetal Face\\r\\nFlying off without me, huh?\\r\\nI know you from somewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view shifts to Fiora inside Face Nemesis.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMetal Face\\r\\nOf course, I remember you.\\r\\nYou\\'re Dunban\\'s little sister.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Bionis area intro: Valak Mountain]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Alvis has led Shulk\\'s party to the snow-covered peak of Valak Mountain at \\r\\nZokhed Pass. Ether crystals dot the frozen landscape, lighting up the snow in a\\r\\nsublime golden glow at night.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI could go for a hot cup of Dickson\\'s homebrew\\r\\nright about now. We\\'re not built for this cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nIt is to be expected. This climate is as different to your\\r\\nhome as it gets. It only snows this high up on the Bionis.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki hate cold!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThis can\\'t be nice for Riki. He\\'s from Makna.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nA little further down is Sword Valley, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nYes. But before then I must\\r\\nshow you something.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMe?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nYou, Shulk.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Alvis looks off towards a large, shimmering tower in the distance.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nDo you not see? That tall formation that\\r\\nlooks like a tower. Ruins, to be precise.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki see it! Bigger than big tree in village!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nWe can rest there. I\\'ll explain everything then.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party arrive at the Sealed Tower, but thick ice blocks the entrance.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nRuins? I wonder who built them.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nAlvis? This the place you meant?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nHmm. It appears to have frozen\\r\\nover while I have been away.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nBeen away?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nPay me no mind.\\r\\nWe will need to do something about\\r\\nthe ice before we can enter.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nThrow hot water on ice!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYeah, nice one genius!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nPrecisely.\\r\\n\\r\\n[View of Jakt Geyser outside the tower.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nThere should be a geyser nearby.\\r\\nIn the cave next to it, we will find\\r\\na stone called Magma Rock.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view returns to the party at the tower\\'s ruins.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAnd we can use this rock to melt the ice?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nI believe so.\\r\\nSo, shall we head to the cave?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSounds good. Start looking\\r\\nfor a geyser, everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The team make their way past Jakt Geyser into the Lava Cave, where they fight \\r\\nConflagrant Raxeal for the Magma Rock. They then return to the tower and melt \\r\\nthe ice covering the door. There is an inscription on this door.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThe letters are worn and difficult to make out.\\r\\nBut it\\'s definitely the language of the High Entia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThey look just like the lettering on Prison Island.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nIf only we could...\\r\\n\\r\\n[On a whim, Dunban walks up, and the door opens.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\n...just walk inside.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The group enter and find an altar inside.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThis place...\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nSomething up, Shulk?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNo...it\\'s just... I feel like I know this place.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nD\\xc3\\xa9j\\xc3\\xa0 vu?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI\\'m not sure, but...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Momentary flashback to Dickson finding Shulk as a child asleep under this \\r\\naltar, when it held the Monado.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI thought I had it.\\r\\nI can\\'t seem to recall...\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Monado glows with blue light on Shulk\\'s back.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nAre you all right?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat? Must be tired.\\r\\nDon\\'t worry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nThis is Ose Tower.\\r\\nBuilt by the High Entia to house and protect the Monado.\\r\\nThe ceremony of seers was conducted here.\\r\\nIt is also where the Homs\\r\\nfound the Monado.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWait, you mean...!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sometime later, the party have made a campfire inside Ose Tower. Shulk goes \\r\\nagain to inspect the altar.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSo this is where the Monado was kept?\\r\\nMy dad took it from here...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk turns to Alvis.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nHave you always been able to see the future?\\r\\nYou told me you are from a long line of seers.\\r\\nDid you have the ability from birth?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nOnce, I too came into contact with the Monado.\\r\\nThose that are to be seers\\r\\nmust touch the Monado.\\r\\nAnd a chosen few receive our power.\\r\\nThat is the ceremony of my family.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nAnd the ceremony was held right here.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nShulk, why do you think we can see the future?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI hadn\\'t really thought about it. After I\\r\\ngrabbed the Monado, I just saw things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nYour visions are the flow of ether itself.\\r\\nEther is the very source of our world\\'s existence.\\r\\nWhere and how much ether there exists now,\\r\\nand in the future, can be predicted.\\r\\nTherefore, in principle, the future of living beings\\r\\nsuch as us can also be predicted.\\r\\nAnd there is one thing that makes possible\\r\\nthe visualisation of those predictions.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou mean the Monado.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nThe Monado can disrupt the ether, allowing you\\r\\nto release certain powers. Which means?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMy visions, under the same principle,\\r\\nare there to disrupt the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nWith no one to control the outcome,\\r\\nthe future will never change.\\r\\nBut what if someone were to disrupt\\r\\nthe future? What then?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThe future would be changed. Is that how\\r\\nZanza planned to defeat the Mechonis?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Alvis nods.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nBut why go to such lengths?\\r\\nWhat happened all those years ago?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nDid you think it was just a myth?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI used to only believe in what I could see.\\r\\nMy home, my friends, the Monado itself!\\r\\nI knew those things were real.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nBut when you took the Monado in your hand, you gained\\r\\nthe ability to see that which was not meant to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nAre you saying I should stop?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nYou are a fluctuation. As a fluctuation, you exist\\r\\noutside the results of your predictions.\\r\\nThe more you accept this existence,\\r\\nthe more malleable the world becomes.\\r\\nIn fact, you have no choice but to accept it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Meanwhile, Dunban is shown listening in on their conversation.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[The next morning, Alvis leads the party outside of Ose Tower back onto the \\r\\nsnowy mountainside.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nGood morning. Did we sleep well?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI can\\'t feel my face or feet. What do you think?\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nReyn not tell truth! Reyn\\'s snoring\\r\\nmake Riki think of Orluga!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nOi! I don\\'t snore!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Alvis laughs, then gets down to business.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nSword Valley is just around the corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party set off across the snow, but Dunban lingers behind a moment.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later, Shulk\\'s group are trekking across the Great Glacier, not far from the \\r\\nBionis\\' Wrist, when Face Nemesis flies overhead.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThat Mechon!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Face Nemesis lands a short ways in front of the group. Shulk runs over, and \\r\\nthe cockpit in the Mechon\\'s chest opens to reveal Fiora again.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt is you.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHey, that\\'s Fiora!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban and Reyn run up to her. Melia and Sharla join them, Alvis moving more \\r\\nslowly towards the rest of the group. Meanwhile, Fiora addresses Shulk, but she\\r\\nstill has the voice and personality of Meyneth.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nYoung Heir to the Monado.\\r\\nWe meet again.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFiora!\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nFiora?\\r\\nIs that my name?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban can be seen approaching.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nThen you...\\r\\nYou know this body?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSo it\\'s true.\\r\\nYou really don\\'t remember us at all.\\r\\nFiora, listen!\\r\\nIf nothing else, you must\\r\\nremember your family!\\r\\nThat\\'s Dunban over there!\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nFamily?\\r\\nThere is family...\\r\\nWielder of the Monado.\\r\\nThere is...a matter I must\\r\\nspeak to you about.\\r\\n\\r\\n[But a blast of energy from off-screen hits her. Fiora cries out in Meyneth\\'s \\r\\nvoice as Face Nemesis is sent crashing into a rocky spire.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFiora!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat was that?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Metal Face flies overhead and lands next to the same rocky spire, bearing down\\r\\non Face Nemesis. His claws are directly above Fiora herself.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMetal Face!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nStay alert!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nYou killed my father!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nGet him!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party charge at Metal Face.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nGet away from her!\\r\\n\\r\\nMetal Face\\r\\nNow, now, let\\'s all calm down.\\r\\nIf I slip, I might mess up her hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nYou\\'re disgusting!\\r\\n\\r\\nMetal Face\\r\\nWould you be so kind and hand over\\r\\nthat dangerous toy you have?\\r\\nI could take it after I smash you all to a pulp.\\r\\nBut we wouldn\\'t want that, would we?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nAll right.\\r\\nYou can have it.\\r\\nBut only if you let her go.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk deactivates the Monado and sticks it in the snow. He backs away with his\\r\\narms out.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMetal Face\\r\\nThere\\'s a good boy.\\r\\nAlways eager to please, Shulk.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Metal Face laughs as he opens his cockpit, revealing the Homs within to be \\r\\nnone other than Mumkhar, Dunban\\'s former comrade-in-arms. The traitor has a \\r\\nbody of dark Mechon armour in place of his previous Homs body.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nBut you\\'re-\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nHow\\'s it going, Dunban?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIs that...?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mumkhar leaps out of his Mechon and takes the Monado.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nMumkhar!\\r\\nI thought it might be, but...\\r\\nYou\\'re to blame for all this?\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nI can\\'t tell you how badly\\r\\nI\\'ve wanted this sword!\\r\\nHas this puny boy even figured out\\r\\nhow it works yet?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mumkhar grabs Shulk by the throat.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nWhat are you willing to do?\\r\\nWould you even kill a Homs to beat us?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban draws his sword.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou dare ask that of us?\\r\\nWhy did you betray us to Mechonis?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mumkhar throws Shulk to the ground.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWhy did you kill our friends at the colony?\\r\\nWhy?!\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nYou wanna know?\\r\\nBecause it\\'s your home.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou piece of...!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban charges Mumkhar in a rage, but Metal Face grabs Fiora\\'s Mechon and pins\\r\\nher to the rock.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nStay where you are.\\r\\nThat thing works by remote.\\r\\n\\r\\n[One of Metal Face\\'s claws rises up towards an unconscious Fiora\\'s throat.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nSo unless you want me to\\r\\nput a hole in her neck...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban gasps.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nSo what\\'s it to be weaklings?\\r\\nGrovel at my feet and beg?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia activates ether energy from her staff.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nWe will not bow to you!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia fires a blast that hits Mumkhar, knocking the Monado out of his hand, \\r\\nand blasts Metal Face, knocking it over.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nMelly hit bad guy in face!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk runs over to the Monado and activates it.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nYou\\'ll pay for that, princess!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mumkhar activates the claws from the his hands, which in his new Mechon body \\r\\nnow glow red instead of being steel as they\\'d been in Sword Valley. By now, the\\r\\nrest of the party have drawn their weapons and ready themselves for battle.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou\\'re a traitor, Mumkhar.\\r\\nAnd you\\'re not getting away.\\r\\n\\r\\n[In the end, the battle comes down to Dunban against Mumkhar, who clash sword \\r\\nand claws against each other furiously across the snowy landscape.

That flowing light.\\r\\n\\r\\n[There are veins of green light flowing through the rusty landscape in the \\r\\nvalley, with green flames lit on top of the walls intermittently.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFrom the way it glows, it has to be ether.\\r\\nBut it looks like it\\'s being\\r\\ndrawn in by something.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nBy the fortress!\\r\\nIt should just be up ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nFather once told me that the Mechonis absorbs the\\r\\nether of the Bionis and uses it for sustenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nSo the Mechonis feeds off ether.\\r\\nThen undoubtedly the ether serves\\r\\nas the Mechon\\'s energy source as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party continue their march down the sloping canyon that comprises the \\r\\nthumb of the Bionis.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mechonis area intro: Sword Valley]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia stops the group once they see Galahad Fortress on the horizon.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nIt looks so big, even from this distance.\\r\\nThe fortress must be enormous.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nGalahad Fortress - the front line base of the Mechon.\\r\\nThe Mechon that attack Bionis must all come from here.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThen there\\'s a high probability that he\\'s there.\\r\\nThe golden Mechon that took Fiora.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk walks forward ahead of the others.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWe\\'re about to enter the Mechon stronghold.\\r\\nIf there\\'s anyone who wants to turn back now...\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nShulk. Friend should no split up.\\r\\nNo leave friend behind.\\r\\nRiki scared but Riki want go too.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nRiki.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk looks around at the others, none of whom show any signs of wanting to \\r\\nturn back.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nHe\\'s right. OK, let\\'s go.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYes!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Upon approaching the sword itself, the team stop at the sight of ships below. \\r\\nReyn goes a little ahead of the others.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat\\'s that?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nA supply convoy.\\r\\nIt would be most unwise to proceed\\r\\nwithout restocking our supplies.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou arranged this for us?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Alvis nods.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHey, it\\'s...!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dickson can be seen next to one of the transports.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDickson!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party run up to him, crossing over into Sword Valley proper in so doing.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nLooks like you lot have been having fun without me.\\r\\nHeard you took care of that faced Mechon.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWhat are you doing here?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nI got wind of some allied force coming\\r\\ntogether a few days back.\\r\\nI stepped up as the representative of the Homs.\\r\\nThen a little birdie told me you lot were\\r\\nheading for Galahad Fortress.\\r\\nSo I thought I\\'d drop by and say hello.\\r\\nI\\'ve got a whole stack of new\\r\\nequipment. Want some?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYeah! I was hoping for some new stuff!\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nHold it, Reyn. You know it\\'s gonna cost you?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou cheap old man!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dickson waves the remark off.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later, after stocking up at the Supply Convoy, Shulk and his companions speak \\r\\nwith Dickson and tell him what has happened.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nFiora? You mean Dunban\\'s sister?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nSo that\\'s why you\\'re all looking so down.\\r\\nI can\\'t believe they\\'re sticking Homs into those faced\\r\\nMechon. Looks like they weren\\'t just eating us.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nThey made Mumkhar into one.\\r\\nHe was the one who attacked Colony 9.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nOh, and there was me thinking\\r\\nhe snuffed it in that battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAren\\'t you surprised?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nThat he attacked Colony 9?\\r\\nI dunno what drives those Mechon.\\r\\nI\\'ve given up trying to figure them out.\\r\\nIt don\\'t surprise me one bit.\\r\\nStill, Mumkhar as well?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dickson gets introspective all of a sudden.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nThings are getting interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSorry?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nOh, nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Alvis comes to Dickson\\'s side.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nIt is time for us to return.\\r\\nI would like to continue providing assistance, but my\\r\\nhelp is required in assembling Homs for the allied force.\\r\\nThere are also my duties as seer to consider.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nThen I\\'ll be off too.\\r\\nYou lot should be all right getting Fiora back.\\r\\nIn the meantime, we\\'ll be getting ready for battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThanks for coming this far.\\r\\nWe\\'ll be fine. We can handle ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nGalahad Fortress is a key position for the Mechon.\\r\\nYou can\\'t just rush in, all guns blazing.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAgreed. We will infiltrate via the ether inlets.\\r\\nIf I\\'m right and the Mechon do feed off ether...\\r\\nThen we\\'re sure to find some form of influx channel.\\r\\nOur objective is to reach one of those channels.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nDon\\'t go dying on me, Shulk!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI won\\'t! You take care as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nCheers!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dickson waves, then he and Alvis depart. The party then watch as their pod \\r\\nsoars into the sky.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nLooks like it\\'s just us.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nRight! We head for the hilt of\\r\\nthe sword - Galahad Fortress.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nOK!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party begin their journey, with Dunban lingering behind a little.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban [inwardly]\\r\\nOne year on. Now, at last,\\r\\nwe will seize our destiny.\\r\\nIsn\\'t that right, Shulk?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Meanwhile in Galahad Fortress, Egil muses inside his golden Mechon. Flashback\\r\\nto Zanza, before he was imprisoned, standing on an open plain on the shoulder \\r\\nof the Bionis overlooking the titan\\'s head. There is another flashback to the \\r\\nbattle between the Bionis and the Mechonis before returning to the present.]\\r\\n\\r\\nEgil\\r\\nSo another has appeared with the\\r\\nability to wield the Monado.\\r\\nBut why would Zanza release the Monado?\\r\\nHe surely knows it would become\\r\\na double-edged sword.\\r\\nYet he relinquishes it to that mere child.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Momentary flashback to Shulk speaking to Fiora within Face Nemesis at the \\r\\nGreat Glacier on Valak Mountain.]\\r\\n\\r\\nEgil\\r\\nAnd a Face escaped my control\\r\\nand acted alone.\\r\\nNow that the Monado has been freed,\\r\\nit appears the usefulness of the\\r\\nFaces has come to an end.\\r\\nAlthough...\\r\\nPerhaps there are still things to be learnt\\r\\nfrom having them challenge the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later, Shulk\\'s party have emerged from the Ether Storage Area in Sword Valley,\\r\\nnear the hilt of the Mechonis\\' sword.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHey, look!\\r\\n\\r\\n[View of the Galahad Fortress Rear Entrance, where there is an ether inlet.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nCan we get in through there?\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view returns to the party.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nIt looks as though it\\'s unguarded.\\r\\nIt should make for a decent entry point.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNow\\'s our chance, Dunban.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYes. But don\\'t lower your guard.\\r\\nThe Mechon may just be hiding.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Upon reaching the Port Access Pathway, Mumkhar steps into their path.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nI\\'ve been waiting for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nMumkhar!\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nHow predictable.\\r\\nI knew you were going to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nHow could you?\\r\\nHow could you do this to your own kind?!\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nThat ain\\'t got nothing to do with it.\\r\\nI\\'m just having the time of my life here!\\r\\nAin\\'t that the point?!\\r\\nI even get to take out\\r\\nthat annoying Monado brat.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nOi, beardy!\\r\\nYou\\'re talkin\\' pretty tough there!\\r\\nDon\\'t be so sure you can\\r\\ntake us all on by yourself!\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nCome on!\\r\\nI ain\\'t that stupid!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The roar of engines is heard.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nWhat\\'s that sound?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[A number of deadly green spears land on the Heavy Machine Depot all around the\\r\\nparty. Then numerous faced Mechon land and surround the group.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou scumbag!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Metal Face begins to rise as Mumkhar activates it by remote.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nWell then, Monado boy.\\r\\nThank ya can do it?\\r\\nCan ya kill \\'em all?\\r\\n\\r\\n[The faced Mechon begin picking up their spears as Mumkhar enters his own \\r\\nMechon.

Your mum?\\r\\nMaybe that special someone!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sharla gasps at the thought.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nAha!\\r\\nLooks like we have our first contestant.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk sees a vision of the immediate future.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nToo bad she won\\'t give me much of a fight!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Metal Face, his claws now infused with the same green substance contained in \\r\\nthe spears, slashes Sharla across her midsection, and the vision ends.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk [inwardly]\\r\\nIt\\'s just like with Zanza!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk [to Sharla]\\r\\nSharla! Look out!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk rushes in front of her as Mumkhar readies his attack.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nToo bad she won\\'t give me much of a fight!\\r\\n\\r\\n[This time, Shulk blocks Metal Face\\'s attack with the Monado.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nEveryone! Watch out for the green claws!\\r\\nAnd the other ones\\' spears!\\r\\nThere\\'s something different about them!\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nYou catch on quick, boy.\\r\\nYou\\'re right. These weapons are special.\\r\\nThey were made especially to decompose\\r\\nyou Homs. No, wait, any being from Bionis.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nHow can that be?!\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nI dunno about all this technical stuff.\\r\\nBut it\\'s something to do with that ether.\\r\\nEther is like the Bionis\\' blood.\\r\\nThe fortress sucks its blood out for us.\\r\\nThen we use it to make this green liquid.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou monsters!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mumkhar laughs.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nPretty clever, don\\'t you think?\\r\\nThis world suits me just fine, Dunban!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nMumkhar! You\\'re gonna pay!\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nI\\'m tired of your yapping, Mr Hero.\\r\\nI\\'m gonna squish you like a slug! Right here,\\r\\nwhere we shared such lovely memories.\\r\\n\\r\\n[At the end of the ensuing battle, Mumkhar\\'s Mechon has sustained critical \\r\\ndamage, Metal Face sparking all across its frame.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nToo much...\\r\\nThe Monado is too much!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mumkhar struggles to keep Metal Face standing.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYes.\\r\\nThis is the power of the Monado!\\r\\nYou wanted it, so now\\r\\nyou can have it, Mumkhar!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban, Enchanted by the Monado, charges at Mumkhar with his sword drawn.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nI\\'m better than all of you!\\r\\nYou\\'re the one who\\'s finished!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Metal Face charges up a ball of light.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nDie!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nStop!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Metal Face\\'s cannon, with which Mumkhar had been charging his attack, is \\r\\nsuddenly severed from the Mechon\\'s frame, flying high into the air, damaging a \\r\\nnearby spear-shaped pillar. Below, Dunban\\'s blade is but an inch from Mumkhar\\'s\\r\\nexposed throat, but it is Shulk with the Monado that blocks Dunban\\'s sword. \\r\\nTheir blades lock.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nGet out of my way!\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s Mumkhar...\\r\\nHe\\'s not a Mechon!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nHave you forgotten everything he\\'s done?\\r\\nWhere is your killer instinct?!\\r\\nNow is the time!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI hate him, Dunban.\\r\\nFor what he did to Fiora.\\r\\nAnd the Emperor.\\r\\nSo of course I want to get my revenge!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nShulk...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk struggles increasingly against the strain of Dunban\\'s might to keep \\r\\nhis sword restrained.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nBut...\\r\\nFace Mechon are not like the others.\\r\\nThey\\'re people! Like us!\\r\\nAre you really willing to\\r\\nkill another Homs?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYes. Sometimes needs must!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nEven if it\\'s Fiora?\\r\\nWhat then?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban is momentarily at a loss for words.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhen we set out, I wanted\\r\\nto destroy all Mechon.\\r\\nThat was my aim.\\r\\nBut now...\\r\\nI know that there are people inside.\\r\\nI have to know why.\\r\\nWhat\\'s the reason for all of this?\\r\\nWhy do Bionis and Mechonis\\r\\nhave to keep on fighting?\\r\\nI have to find out why!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nSo, that is your fight?\\r\\n\\r\\n[At last, Dunban relents and pulls his sword away. Mumkhar reaches up with \\r\\nMetal Face\\'s claws to attack.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nPathetic!\\r\\n\\r\\n[But with incredible speed, Dunban slashes through Metal Face\\'s arm at the \\r\\nshoulder.

Above, the \\r\\npillar hit by Metal Face\\'s severed cannon begins to totter.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDunban!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI will never forgive\\r\\nwhat he\\'s done.\\r\\nAnd yet...\\r\\nYour words.\\r\\nThey ring true.\\r\\nI feel\\r\\ntheir weight.\\r\\nWe have to help Fiora now.\\r\\nWe\\'ll worry about the rest later.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nRight!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nDid you hear that, Mumkhar?\\r\\nWe haven\\'t got time to be\\r\\nplaying around with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nYou always had to\\r\\nhave the last word!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk sees another vision of the immediate future.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nJust die!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mumkhar then charges at Shulk and Dunban from within Metal Face, but the \\r\\nspear-like pillar above falls and impales him, ending the vision.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk and Mumkhar [simultaneously]\\r\\n- No! Don\\'t move!\\r\\n- Just die!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nStay back!\\r\\n\\r\\n[But Mumkhar charges forward inside Metal Face, shooting off a blast at Shulk \\r\\nand Dunban. Shulk tackles Dunban to get them both out of the way. The blast \\r\\nthen hits the wall behind them, causing the tottering spear-like pillar to \\r\\nfall, which then impales Mumkhar straight through his Mechon.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nMumkhar!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The ground starts shaking, and the Heavy Machine Depot breaks off from the \\r\\nrest of the structure, plummeting into the abyss and taking Mumkhar and his \\r\\nMechon with it.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMumkhar\\r\\nNo! No!\\r\\nNot like this!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The platform, Metal Face and Mumkhar all disappear in a tiny conflagration so \\r\\nfar below as to be almost beyond sight.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nMumkhar...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Melia looks down sorrowfully where Mumkhar fell.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou went too far, you fool.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban then walks away from the edge as Shulk continues to look down.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Elsewhere, Lorithia studies the green fluid-laced spear that had impaled \\r\\nZanza. Alvis enters behind her.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLorithia\\r\\nThey are of surprisingly little use...\\r\\nThose visions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nBecause he could not save His Majesty?\\r\\nThat was within the margin of fate.\\r\\nIt was not Shulk\\'s fault.\\r\\n\\r\\nLorithia\\r\\nHmm. So you side with the boy?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Alvis shakes his head and changes the subject.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nDid you find anything out?\\r\\n\\r\\nLorithia\\r\\nI did. It is most fascinating, this spear.\\r\\nThe green fluid alters and destroys the structure of the ether,\\r\\nwhich is the building block of life on Bionis.\\r\\nIt appears to have been created from ether\\r\\nenergy drawn from the blood of the Bionis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nCould that explain the ether flowing\\r\\nthrough Sword Valley?\\r\\n\\r\\nLorithia\\r\\nI do not think it is the only reason,\\r\\nbut it is too early to draw conclusions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nIs there a countermeasure?\\r\\n\\r\\nLorithia\\r\\nCreating antibodies is a simple matter.\\r\\nWe will be ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nThat is good news.\\r\\n\\r\\nLorithia\\r\\nWhy did you have to include him?\\r\\nYou know how he disgusts me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlvis\\r\\nWe must respect our elders.\\r\\nDickson has known him far longer than us.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Meanwhile, back at Sword Valley, Shulk and the others regroup.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nAt least he\\'s out of the way.\\r\\nNow we just need to get inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThey\\'re in there. Fiora and the golden Mechon.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The group head towards Galahad Fortress, but Shulk is stopped by a vision: \\r\\nFiora\\'s Mechon, flanked by other faced Mechon, walks forward. She holds her \\r\\nblade up, which appears to quiver. The vision shifts to Shulk crying out, then \\r\\nto Face Nemesis falling out of the fortress as the floor collapses underneath \\r\\nher, sending her into a fall similar to the one Mumkhar just took. Here the \\r\\nvision ends.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFiora!\\r\\n\\r\\n[This outburst stops the others.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn runs back to him.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat\\'s up?!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nDid you see something?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nNo...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban shakes his head.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou did see something.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nAll right. It was the silver Mechon... Fiora.\\r\\nShe\\'s definitely inside the fortress.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAll right. At least we know what to expect.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk [inwardly]\\r\\nSo Fiora is inside.\\r\\nI can\\'t let that vision come true.\\r\\nI have to save her!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Soon, the party arrive at the Fortress Rear Entrance.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHere\\'s our way in.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThere\\'s no turning back.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWe can\\'t let them find us. Let\\'s move!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nRight!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The group enter the fortress.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mechonis area intro: Galahad Fortress]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk\\'s group arrive at the Main Maintenance Bay. Rows of Mechon line each of \\r\\nthe Fuel Supply Rooms, and gears whir in the maintenance bay.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFiora\\'s in here somewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nLet\\'s get looking. Keep your eyes peeled.\\r\\nI\\'m ready for anything. I\\'ll trash any\\r\\nMechon that tries to mess with us!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk nods and then looks ahead. After finding the Fortress Pass Key in the \\r\\n2nd Fuel Supply Room, the group unlock the lift and reach the Main Control Room\\r\\none floor down.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhere are we?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nLooks like the control room for an ether blast furnace.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sharla walks over to the observation window.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThere, look at that.\\r\\n\\r\\n[View of a pipeline leading to the Piston Control Room. Ether flows into a \\r\\ncavernous pit below.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nSo this is what supplies the\\r\\nMechon with ether energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nShulk! What\\'s that?!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view shifts to the pistons pumping beyond the window, then to the party in\\r\\nthe control room.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nLooks like fun! Riki want to ride!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWe didn\\'t come here to mess about, furball!\\r\\nTime to bounce on!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nHold on!\\r\\nIf we can stop that piston, we might be\\r\\nable to shut down the blast furnace.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nNice idea.\\r\\nCut off the Mechon\\'s ether supply.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki say we try!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYeah, but how are we supposed to stop\\r\\nsomething that massive?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIf we can stop the turbines driving\\r\\nthe piston, it should work.\\r\\nAnd the turbines should be nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nRight. Let\\'s search for them.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party then proceed to stop both turbines powering the piston so that the \\r\\nEther Blast Furnace is no longer functioning.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nNice one! We did it!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nThis should prevent them from mobilising any\\r\\nlarge Mechon squads for now. Hopefully we\\'ve\\r\\nimproved the allied force\\'s chances.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nHold steady, my brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n[A couple red-lit doors light up green and open.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nFriends! Here here!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The others come to the railing where Riki is pointing them. Below, they see \\r\\none of the open doors.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt looks like the door\\'s been unlocked.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nNice. Let\\'s get down to the blast furnace.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIf we\\'re lucky, Fiora might be down there.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later, the party find a lift that takes them down to the Face Maintenance Bay.\\r\\nMechon Face units holding green spears line the walls but are inactive.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nShulk, is that?\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nSpear ones! Loads and loads of spear Mechon!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Just then, a siren sounds. A door opens revealing a couple Mechon Guard Units.\\r\\nShulk gasps. The party attempt to run, but a larger door opens in front of \\r\\nthem. Behind it, Face Nemesis stands in their way.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt\\'s Fiora!\\r\\n\\r\\n[This time, however, Fiora draws the twin blades from her Mechon unit and \\r\\nengages Shulk\\'s party in battle, aided by the other Mechon in the area.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[In the fight that follows, Shulk and the others destroy the Guard Units \\r\\nwithout harming Face Nemesis. Afterwards, they try to talk to Fiora.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nStop! Don\\'t you recognise Shulk?!\\r\\nFiora!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFiora. Please. Don\\'t you remember us at all?!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nIt\\'s no use.\\r\\nEveryone, it\\'s time to retreat.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nGot it!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nUnderstood.\\r\\n\\r\\n[They all make to leave except Shulk.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nMove! Shulk!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Finally, Shulk joins the others in retreating as Face Nemesis looks on.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[The party make it nearly to the Fortress Depths, but Fiora\\'s Mechon overtakes \\r\\nthem and blasts the bridge they\\'re running across. It collapses underneath \\r\\nthem, sending them falling and screaming.

I\\'ve only just come round.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhere are the others?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nI looked for them, but they\\'re nowhere to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nOh.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nReyn, thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHuh?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nFor protecting me, back there.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYeah, it got rough but at least you got out safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nWhat is it?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nLook at me, I\\'m useless.\\r\\nCan\\'t even keep a promise.\\r\\nI promised Fiora I\\'d look after Shulk. Stupid...\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nYou promised to protect the guy who\\r\\nprotects you? Am I missing something?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIn the old days, Shulk was kinda frail. You know, like a little\\r\\nBunniv that gets bossed around by the other colony animals.\\r\\nIt was me who used to be there, to save him.\\r\\nThat\\'s why I promised Fiora. But now look at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nReyn.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nHe\\'s stronger now. And not just\\r\\n\\'cos he\\'s got the Monado.\\r\\nI\\'ve done all I can to help him.\\r\\nHe doesn\\'t need me.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThat\\'s not the Reyn I know.\\r\\nDo you remember Colony 6?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThe Mechon were always on the doorstep\\r\\nof our home, the colony.\\r\\nThinking about it, I realise they\\r\\nwere after the ether underneath it.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYeah. I suppose so.\\r\\nIf they could stockpile energy from there,\\r\\nthey could get to any part of Bionis.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThe Colony 6 defence force suffered its fair\\r\\nshare of pain. And not just physical.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn grunts in understanding.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nFriends and family...alive one day...\\r\\ngone the next. It all became so normal.\\r\\nYou end up wondering how you can possibly\\r\\nmake a difference when war is so futile.\\r\\nI\\'m not the only one who felt like that sometimes.\\r\\nBut nobody ever gave up. And you know why?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nBecause you were strong?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nWe had no choice but to be strong.\\r\\nEverybody had someone to protect. The moment\\r\\nyou looked away, you\\'d lose everyone you loved.\\r\\nSo we had to keep looking straight ahead.\\r\\nWe couldn\\'t stop fighting.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nMan, that\\'s tough. Puts my problems into perspective.\\r\\nI suppose I should get back to being Reyn.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nDon\\'t go doubting yourself,\\r\\neven if things get tough.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou\\'re right.\\r\\nThere\\'ll be plenty of time to stare at my feet\\r\\nwhen I\\'m old and crooked. Get it?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nI get it. So now what?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWe go looking for Shulk and Fiora!\\r\\nI might be like a third wheel, but I can still\\r\\nlug around the heavy stuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nFinally! That\\'s the Reyn I know.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Soon, Reyn and Sharla get set to leave.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nBack there, were you talking\\r\\nabout that guy Gadolt?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nNot just about him. Why do you ask?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nNothing. Just... You know... Seems like tough\\r\\ncompetition for a guy like me.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sharla chuckles.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nReyn.\\r\\n\\r\\n[A little bit farther on, Sharla stops.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nDo you think Shulk and the others are OK?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\n\\'Course they are. They wouldn\\'t die\\r\\nfrom something like that.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nBack to your old self I see!\\r\\nRight, we\\'d better get looking.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later, once they reach Ulna Passage, Reyn and Sharla hear Mechon.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nWhat\\'s that sound?!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nSomeone\\'s in a fight! Up ahead!\\r\\n\\r\\n[They run down to see Shulk engaged with the same pair of Mechon from before.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI got your back. We\\'ll turn them into scrap!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nRight!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn and Sharla help Shulk destroy both Mechon.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nGood to see ya.\\r\\nI knew you\\'d make it, Shulk.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThanks to you!\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora [O.C.]\\r\\nReyn!\\r\\nReyn, it\\'s you!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The group turn to find Fiora walking towards them.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nFiora!\\r\\nShe remembers us!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn places an arm around Shulk.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\nShe\\'s been through a lot.\\r\\n\\r\\n[As she comes closer, Reyn gets a chance to look over her new Mechon body.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI can see.\\r\\n\\r\\n[A short time later, Shulk, Fiora, Reyn and Sharla are all sitting together in \\r\\nthe passage.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIf only we could find Dunban.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYeah, he\\'ll be blubbering at the sight of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nHahaha!\\r\\nI don\\'t think he\\'d ever\\r\\ncry in front of you two.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nSo he does cry?!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhen no one\\'s watching?\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nYep. He\\'s always been like that. He\\'s a\\r\\nbig softy, but he hates anyone seeing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI never knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nNope! I don\\'t believe it!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora and Sharla both get to their feet.]\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nTake it easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nI\\'m OK. I want to see my brother.\\r\\nLet\\'s go, Shulk.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and Reyn stand up.]\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIf you can\\'t walk, I\\'ll carry you.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nI\\'m much heavier now.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI\\'ve been pumping my guns.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Now Fiora examines Reyn\\'s body.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nI can see!\\r\\nReyn, you really looked after Shulk for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI wanted to, but it feels more like he\\'s\\r\\nthe one who\\'s been protecting me.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThat\\'s not true!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nIt\\'s OK. I know it, you know it.\\r\\nI\\'m not here to protect you anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nBut you are here for something.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYeah. What I did just now.\\r\\nIt don\\'t matter how strong you get, you ain\\'t\\r\\ngot eyes in the back of your head.\\r\\nSo I\\'ve got your back!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReyn, you...\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nReyn, you\\'re like a whole new person.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWhat do you mean by that?!\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nI mean, it\\'s good you\\'ve become so dependable.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nWas I that un-dependable before?\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nTake it as a compliment!\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou haven\\'t changed a bit.\\r\\nWhat would we do without you?\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nRight, let\\'s go. You wanna see\\r\\nmy brother cry, don\\'t you?\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYeah, wouldn\\'t miss it!\\r\\n\\r\\n[As the four friends leave Ulna Passage and make their way outside, Fiora stops\\r\\nwith a gasp.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat is it?\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nI can hear something.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nWhat? I can\\'t hear anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMaybe our sense of hearing isn\\'t strong enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nLow sounds. More than one.\\r\\nWatch out! Something\\'s here!\\r\\n\\r\\n[A group of mechanical beings slowly approach the group.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Elsewhere, Riki leads the way in front of Dunban and Melia along Inlet Beach. \\r\\nSoon, the Heropon comes to a stop.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nFriends stop for Riki!\\r\\nRiki very hungry! And Riki sleepy!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Riki shakes his head and turns back to look at the other two.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nIf Riki not rest now, Riki not keep going!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWe can\\'t have that, can we?\\r\\nWe\\'ll rest here before going any further.\\r\\nMelia, do you need to rest?\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nI am fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nGood! Break time!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later that night, Melia is sound asleep next to a campfire as Dunban keeps \\r\\nwatch beside her. He is jolted out of his reverie when Riki drops a fish next \\r\\nto him.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWhat\\'s this?\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nHeropon Riki have big fight with fish. Riki win.\\r\\nGrilled fish taste yum yum! Dundun eat too.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI thought you said you couldn\\'t move if you didn\\'t rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki very tired. But Riki very hungry too.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nHow considerate of you.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki not understand Dundun!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nDon\\'t try to hide it. You realised\\r\\nMelia was lagging behind.\\r\\nShe would never admit how tired she was.\\r\\nThat\\'s the real reason you asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Riki walks over to the fish. In time, it is prepared in the campfire, and he \\r\\nand Dunban eat.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nNow that\\'s good fish. Even in this strange place,\\r\\nat least the fish tastes like it should.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki glad Dundun like yum yum fish!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYeah, thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nMelly is tired, but Riki tired too.\\r\\nAnd Dundun not look happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWhat\\'s this? Am I that transparent?\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki want to hear Dundun\\'s story.\\r\\nRiki listen carefully.\\r\\nFor Riki is the Heropon.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI\\'m not sure what that\\'s got to do with it.\\r\\nWell, seeing as you\\'re here. I\\'ll tell you.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nYay! Riki listen.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI have a sister. Her name is Fiora.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki know. She wears silver armour.\\r\\nShulk look everywhere for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nIndeed. Shulk and Fiora...\\r\\nEveryone knows they like each other,\\r\\nbut they\\'re just not ready I suppose.\\r\\nThey are the perfect match, but if they\\r\\ndon\\'t hurry up and tell each other...\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nEven Riki know that!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban gets to his feet.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI suppose everyone does.\\r\\nBut now Fiora has become something else.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nShe forget Shulk. She forget Dundun too.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nShe did.\\r\\nBut, Shulk won\\'t give up that easily.\\r\\nKnowing that he\\'s out there looking for her fills\\r\\nme with hope. I just wish I was there with him...\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nDundun take care of them!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nHmm?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Riki walks over to stand opposite Dunban.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nDundun watch over Shulk.\\r\\nDundun watch over Fiora.\\r\\nThat is all a daddypon can do.\\r\\nRiki make mistake. Dundun not daddypon.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWell, I am her older brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nBut just like daddypon, watching over family.\\r\\nSame watch over.\\r\\nDundun do what he must.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWho would have thought it?\\r\\nI never imagined I would be\\r\\ngetting such advice from you.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki have big family of littlepon.\\r\\nRiki raised and say goodbye to many littlepon.\\r\\nRiki know some things.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou can say that again.\\r\\nI had you all wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The two share a laugh. The next morning, Melia comes over to Dunban and Riki.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nIt doesn\\'t look like the others are here.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nUnfortunate. I hope everyone is safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nEveryone safe. Everyone strong!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nRiki is right.\\r\\nIt is simply a matter of when\\r\\nwe will happen across them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nEveryone landed in the same area.\\r\\nThey have to be around here somewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Riki has wandered over to the entrance of a large pipe behind them.]\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nFriends look here!\\r\\nRiki find it yesterday when Riki go scouting.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban and Melia walk over to the long pipe, which stretches across the small \\r\\nbeach towards a wall beyond.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nI wonder where this pipe leads.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nGo go! Riki has feeling Shulk and friends\\r\\nare on other side!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nFeeling?\\r\\nWell, I\\'m willing to give your Nopon instinct a try.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nAs am I. The pipe it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n[On the other side of the pipe, Dunban, Melia and Riki find themselves walking \\r\\ninto a Hidden Village.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nA village in a place like this!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk [O.C.]\\r\\nMelia!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk, Reyn and Sharla run towards the entrance of the village to meet Dunban,\\r\\nMelia and Riki.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nGuys!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The six friends run to each other.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou\\'re all right!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Riki affectionately bops Reyn in the face.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn grabs Riki by the tuft of fur on his head.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nAnd...\\r\\nWe found Fiora.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora walks up behind them. Deeply moved, Dunban walks towards her.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nDunban.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nFiora!\\r\\nDo you remember me?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora nods as her brother reaches her.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nSorry if I made you worry.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nIt\\'s all right.\\r\\nI\\'m just so glad you\\'re alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nDear brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora embraces Dunban. Dunban uses his one good arm to hug her back as the \\r\\nothers look on.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nShulk, is that your childhood friend?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nCongratulations.\\r\\nI\\'m glad she is safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\nI couldn\\'t have done it without you.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nBut how did you all get here?\\r\\nAnd what is this place anyway?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban inhales sharply as the mechanical beings from earlier come up the \\r\\nramp towards the group.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThese people helped us.\\r\\nThis is their home.\\r\\n\\r\\n??? [O.C.]\\r\\nYour surprise is understandable.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The woman speaking, Linada, walks through her fellow villagers towards the \\r\\n\\r\\nreunited party.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nWe are the Machina.\\r\\nThe people of Mechonis.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk\\'s party meet with the Machina at the bottom of the ramp.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nMachina... You mean, machine people?\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nYou look as if you have many questions.\\r\\nBut please take a look around our village first.\\r\\nWe will talk after that.\\r\\nI will be waiting in front of\\r\\nthe building we call Junks.\\r\\n\\r\\n[View of a large ship, Junks, docked in the lake behind Linada.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Mechonis area intro: Hidden Machina Village]\\r\\n\\r\\n[In addition to Junks, there are small mechanical homes situated on the \\r\\nperimeter as various Machina villagers go to and fro.

Is that correct?\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nFrom our perspective, you are forms\\r\\nof organic life born of the Bionis.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nLife born of the Mechonis...\\r\\nSo there is life here, just like on Bionis?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nExplain to us why you invaded our world.\\r\\nWhat did we ever do to you?\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nI understand your feelings, but please...\\r\\nThere is much yet to tell you.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nDunban, please hear her out.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nBut...\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nThese Machina... They\\'re good people.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora clutches at her chest.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFiora?\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nYou do not look fully functional.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nEver since she was given this body,\\r\\nshe hasn\\'t been feeling too good.\\r\\nBut we honestly don\\'t know what to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nDo you mean to tell me you are not Machina?\\r\\nWhy didn\\'t you tell me sooner?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora straightens up.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nI\\'m OK, really.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nNonsense! I am a doctor.\\r\\nDo not worry. I specialise in\\r\\npeople in your situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Linada comes closer to take a look at Fiora.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nJust as I thought.

Is that the Monado?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt is.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nAnd the destruction of the fortress on the sword.\\r\\nWas that your lot\\'s doing?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYes.\\r\\nAlthough unfortunately we\\r\\nwere unable to stop Egil.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nEgil?\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nDo you know him?

Look at you. One little scratch and\\r\\nyou\\'re already crying for help.\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nI cannot deny this.\\r\\nThe attack did serve as the catalyst.\\r\\nBut the fact remains that things have changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtharon\\r\\nWhen we needed help at the Battle of\\r\\nSword Valley, our cries were ignored.\\r\\nGive me one good reason why we should bother.\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nI understand your anger.\\r\\nOur selfishness was inexcusable.\\r\\nHowever, please hear what I have to say.\\r\\nListen to why our stance has changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtharon\\r\\nHmph.\\r\\nStart talking if you like. But no promises\\r\\nwe\\'ll stick around till the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nWe High Entia were mistaken.\\r\\nWe believed that if we were attacked by the Mechon,\\r\\nour power alone could repel them.\\r\\nBut a brave group of young heroes\\r\\nshowed us the error of our ways.\\r\\nWhen the Mechon descended upon Eryth Sea,\\r\\nShulk fought with a courage I have never seen.\\r\\nI was most surprised to see that this\\r\\ngroup was comprised of different races.\\r\\nHoms, Nopon, High Entia; although different,\\r\\nthey trusted one another as friends.\\r\\nAs just one inhabitant of Bionis, I desired to...\\r\\nNo, I felt compelled to become strong, like them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtharon\\r\\nTheir strength came from the Monado.\\r\\nBravery only gets you so far in this world.\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nThen you will not join us?\\r\\n\\r\\nOtharon\\r\\nHold your horses, son.

I\\'ve got a pretty good idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nDickson!\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nYeah?\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nIf you should meet Shulk...\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nWhat?\\r\\n\\r\\nKallian\\r\\nI have something I want you to tell him.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Meanwhile, on the bridge of Junks in Hidden Machina Village, Miqol continues \\r\\nhis audience with Shulk\\'s party.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou want us to kill your son?\\r\\nThat is no small request.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nThere are hardly any of us Machina left on Mechonis.\\r\\nBack when the Bionis and the Mechonis were fighting,\\r\\nthe Bionis almost completely wiped us out.\\r\\nI suppose the Bionis just didn\\'t want us around.\\r\\nLady Meyneth fought the Bionis for us.\\r\\nIn the end, the two titans wounded each other\\r\\nand entered a deep slumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nWho was Lady Meyneth?\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nThe creator of Mechonis. You could\\r\\nsay that she is the Mechonis itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou talk like you saw all this.\\r\\nAin\\'t this all just an ancient myth?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Miqol chuckles.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nI know I look young, but I\\'m actually quite old.\\r\\nI saw the whole thing with my own eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYou can\\'t be serious?!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThe people of Mechonis must have a longer lifespan.\\r\\nJust like we High Entia live far longer than Homs.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nI get that, but he can\\'t have lived that long.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk [to Miqol]\\r\\nBut why do you want your son dead?\\r\\nFrom what you\\'ve told us, I would\\'ve thought you\\'d want us\\r\\nto destroy the Bionis rather than kill your own son.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nEgil was a brilliant young man.\\r\\nClever, strong and kind to the less able.\\r\\nBut he never forgave the Bionis for what it did,\\r\\nand he swore to take revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nSo he wants to do to us what the\\r\\nBionis did to the Machina?\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nCorrect. Egil is trying to eradicate all\\r\\ninnocent life on Bionis.\\r\\nHe has to be stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nDidn\\'t you ever try to stop him?\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nWe tried, once. A lot of people were killed.\\r\\nHe\\'s blinded by revenge.

But why us?\\r\\nYou should be aware that Shulk\\'s sword, the Monado,\\r\\nhas the power to destroy Mechonis weaponry.\\r\\nIt\\'s said that it was once the sword of the Bionis.\\r\\nDoesn\\'t the very sight of it make you quiver?\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nZanza...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dunban makes a questioning sound.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nJust talking to myself.\\r\\nIf you\\'re gonna kill Egil, you\\'ll\\r\\nneed all of that sword\\'s power.\\r\\nThat\\'s how strong Egil is.\\r\\nBut enough talk, you must be tired.\\r\\nTake your time and think it over.\\r\\nUntil the young lady\\'s treatment has finished\\r\\nfeel free to spend time in our village.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Miqol dismisses the group with a hearty laugh.]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Elsewhere in Junks, Linada and Sharla look after Fiora, who is resting on a \\r\\nbed in Linada\\'s laboratory.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nShe has done well to survive such injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nWhat do you mean? Is she sick?\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nSince you seem to have knowledge of\\r\\nHoms medicine, I\\'ll explain it like this.\\r\\nI\\'m afraid she\\'s had several of her\\r\\norgans removed.\\r\\nAm I correct in assuming she was configured\\r\\nto operate inside a Mechon?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThat\\'s right.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nShe has been transformed into\\r\\na Mechon\\'s central nerve unit.\\r\\nHer blood can now circulate through\\r\\na Mechon\\'s components.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nHow?\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nI believe her immune system is now configured\\r\\nfor compatibility with the Mechon.\\r\\nThat\\'s why her strength has depleted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nBut you can treat her, can\\'t you? Please!\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nOf course.\\r\\nEven as a Machina doctor, I cannot turn\\r\\na blind eye to this butchery.\\r\\nWith our equipment she will regain her strength, but...\\r\\nShe will be stuck with this body.\\r\\nI cannot restore her flesh and blood Homs body.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nThat\\'s OK.\\r\\nI don\\'t want to be a burden to Shulk.\\r\\nI don\\'t care if I have a machine body.\\r\\nJust make it so I can fight beside him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nFiora...\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nLeave it to me. If that is\\r\\nyour wish, I\\'ll do my best.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk enters, and Linada meets him as he comes in.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nI must implant a new circulation\\r\\nsystem for her immune functions.\\r\\nBut we have one problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nA problem?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Linada walks back to Fiora\\'s side.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nI don\\'t have a Piezoelectric Unit, which is\\r\\nrequired to control such a system.\\r\\nAs long as she remains on this bed,\\r\\nthe life support machine can compensate.\\r\\nBut to move around freely, she\\r\\nmust have the Piezoelectric Unit.\\r\\nThe same unit is used in Mechon, so\\r\\nif you were to find some Mechon parts...\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nBut where?\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nWell, outside of the village, at the\\r\\nbase of Digit 5, there is a beach.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view shifts to an aerial view of Hidden Village that pans out to the \\r\\nvarious digits, including Digit 5.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nDebris from above washes ashore there.\\r\\nYou might be able to find one\\r\\namong the Mechon wreckage.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view returns to the Junks interior.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWe\\'ll take a look.\\r\\nThe beach at the base of Digit 5, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nYes. It gives off a faint red glow so\\r\\nit might be easier to find at night.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk and the party find a Piezoelectric Unit amongst the Mechon wreckage on \\r\\nDigit 5 Beach and take it to Linada on Junks.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI think we found it.\\r\\nIs this the Piezoelectric Unit?\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nYes, that\\'s it. Well done.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nLinada, will Fiora be OK now?\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nShe\\'ll be fine.\\r\\nIt will just take me a little time to\\r\\nreconfigure and install the unit.\\r\\nLeave it to me. You get some rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nBut!\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nShulk, do you want her to see you looking\\r\\nexhausted when she wakes up?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYou\\'re right. I\\'ll try and get some rest.\\r\\nThank you for everything you\\'re doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nBy the way...\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYes?\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nThe chief says he wants to speak with you.\\r\\nI think it\\'s about Egil.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI\\'ll go and see him.\\r\\nHe wants Egil stopped, and so do we.\\r\\nBut I need to sleep on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nGood. You mustn\\'t overburden yourself.\\r\\nWe will help you in any way we can.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later, Shulk and his companions use a room prepared by a Machina villager to \\r\\ntake a rest. The next day, the party meet with Miqol on the bridge of Junks.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nUmm...\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nHow are you? Sleep well?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYes, very well.\\r\\nI wanted to...talk about your son.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nHave you made up your mind?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYes.\\r\\nWe agree with you.\\r\\nEgil must be stopped.\\r\\nBut we can\\'t act now.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nWhy\\'s that?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nBefore we came here, we heard of plans\\r\\nto form an allied force on Bionis.\\r\\nAny day now they\\'re going to launch an\\r\\nattack on Mechonis. But it\\'s too dangerous.\\r\\nEgil has made a weapon that could kill us all.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nThe weapon that Mumkhar was using?\\r\\nThe one that shoots green fluid?\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nHe said it can decompose any being from Bionis.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWe have to go back and warn them.\\r\\nBefore it\\'s too late.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The door to the bridge opens, and Dickson enters.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nWell, you could always ask me to do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDickson?! What are you doing here?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dickson steps up to the group.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI can\\'t believe you found us.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nWhy? This place is directly below the fortress.\\r\\nIf you fell from up there, I figured you must\\'ve\\r\\nended up here. And Bob\\'s your uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nYou\\'re looking well, Dickson.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nI see you\\'re lookin\\' like your usual old self.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nYou know each other?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nKinda.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Miqol chuckles.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nI scratch his back, he scratches mine.\\r\\nHe tells us about the outside world, and we\\r\\ngive him technology and information.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban [to Dickson]\\r\\nWhy did you keep that to yourself?\\r\\nThat information is vital to all who fight Mechonis.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nNot all of us Homs are good people. What\\'d happen\\r\\nif the Mechonis-hating types found this place?\\r\\nThese Machina cut themselves off from the\\r\\nworld to get away from pointless fighting.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nSo they escaped to live in peace?\\r\\nSomewhere they wouldn\\'t be seen. Makes sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nClever little crown princess, ain\\'t ya.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nSo this is where you obtained all that\\r\\nstuff you brought back to Colony 9.\\r\\nI wondered where you were getting it from.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nI thought it was fine as long as it\\r\\nhelped Shulk out at the lab.\\r\\nI guess the secret\\'s out now.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dickson turns to Shulk.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nSo, that weapon.\\r\\nHow dangerous are we talkin\\' about?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI haven\\'t discovered why, but it\\r\\ndisintegrates anything it touches.\\r\\nBut only if it\\'s living tissue from Bionis.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nBet that would come in handy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nDickson!\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nI\\'m only jokin\\'. Anyway, for now just\\r\\ndon\\'t let any of it touch you.\\r\\nI\\'ll come up with something to counter it.\\r\\nLeave it with me and I\\'ll keep ya posted.\\r\\nYou lot go and take care of that\\r\\nEgil or whatever his name is.\\r\\nIf you take him down, the allied force\\r\\nmight not even be needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nOK!\\r\\nLet me think about it for a bit.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Afterwards, Shulk visits Fiora in Linada\\'s laboratory and takes her hand.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFiora.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Dickson later finds Shulk outside Junks looking across the village\\'s lake.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nAin\\'t made your mind up yet?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDickson, listen.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nDunban told me all about it. The goal of your\\r\\nmission. So you wanted to avenge Fiora?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nBut you found her alive. And now you\\'ve got\\r\\nher back. So you\\'re all done now, ain\\'t ya?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk sighs.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWhat are you fighting for, Dickson?\\r\\n\\r\\n[View of the Mechonis, high overhead, holding its sword across the sky.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nMe? He just gets right under my skin. That Egil guy.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nBecause he\\'s trying to exterminate the Homs?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nThere\\'s that. But that ain\\'t everything.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view returns to Shulk and Dickson.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nIt\\'s his hatred for the Bionis, or more like his aim to\\r\\nwipe out everything that lives on the Bionis.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk takes a sharp breath.]\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nI\\'ll tell you one thing. That Bionis allied force\\r\\nis coming together quicker than I thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReally?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nYep. That High Entia prince is\\r\\nreally movin\\' things along.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWill they launch an attack on Mechonis?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nOf course. But it looks like the prince has got\\r\\nanother plan. He gave me a message for you.\\r\\nWhen the allied force attacks Mechonis,\\r\\nyou don\\'t need to join the fight.\\r\\nHe wants you to take advantage of the\\r\\nchaos and do what it is you need to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nPrince Kallian said that?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nI was pretty surprised too.\\r\\nHe looks like a sissy, but he\\'s got guts.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYeah. I think that\\'s the type of man he is.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nSo what are you gonna do?\\r\\nHe wanted me to let him know.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWe\\'re going to the Mechonis capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nYou\\'re gonna take down Egil?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI don\\'t know.\\r\\nI can\\'t forgive the Mechon for what they\\'ve done. But after\\r\\nlistening to Miqol, I think there might be another way.\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nYou\\'re too soft.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDo you really think that?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nToo right. He\\'s the self-proclaimed leader of Mechonis.\\r\\nI heard about what he did to the Monado.\\r\\nIf you face him, it might get eaten up.\\r\\nBut you have to throw everything at him,\\r\\neven if there\\'s only a slim chance of winning.\\r\\nHesitate for one second and you\\'re a goner.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora [O.C.]\\r\\nWe won\\'t let Shulk die. Not ever!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora and the rest of the party walk up.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFiora!\\r\\nAre you OK to be walking around?\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nYep!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nI have to hand it to her. That Linada\\'s pretty good.\\r\\nAnd not just with machines. She\\'s also quite familiar\\r\\nwith organic physiology.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora [to Shulk]\\r\\nYou went to get the thing she needed to cure me, right?\\r\\nI\\'m sorry I\\'ve caused all this hassle.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk shakes his head.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nBut I\\'m fine now. I\\'ll be by your\\r\\nside, fighting to protect you.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora walks up to Dickson.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nNo matter where we go, no matter how\\r\\ndifficult it gets, Shulk will do the right thing.\\r\\nIt doesn\\'t matter how slim our chances,\\r\\nShulk will always stick to the right path.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nAnd don\\'t forget, it\\'s because of Shulk\\r\\nthat we\\'re all here, fighting together.\\r\\nI think that shows he has a strong character.\\r\\nAm I wrong, Dickson?\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nWell, when I think about everything you\\r\\nlot have done, I can\\'t deny that.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDickson, we\\'re going to the Mechonis capital.\\r\\nAbout the allied force...\\r\\n\\r\\nDickson\\r\\nYeah, leave it to me. I ain\\'t gonna\\r\\nlet anything happen to the colony.\\r\\nThose Mechon won\\'t get away with anything else.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Later, Miqol meets Shulk\\'s party outside Junks, near the village entrance.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nAre you going?\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYes. Thank you for all your help.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Miqol laughs in gratitude.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nYou might run into someone\\r\\ncalled Vanea in the capital.\\r\\nJust mention my name and she\\'ll lend a hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nVanea...\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIs she a Machina as well?\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nShe\\'s my daughter. She won\\'t be far from Egil.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nHold on. You mean she\\'s Egil\\'s sister?\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nYou\\'ve got it, lad.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nAnd you say she\\'ll help us?\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nThe girl doesn\\'t want to hurt Egil,\\r\\nbut she doesn\\'t like what he\\'s doing.\\r\\nShe should be a big help to you young \\'uns.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI dunno why she\\'d help us, but...\\r\\nWe\\'ll try and find her when we get there.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Miqol laughs again.]\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nGood luck.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Linada comes over to Fiora.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nFiora, don\\'t forget. I\\'ve only\\r\\nmade temporary repairs.\\r\\nI think you should be able to fight\\r\\nbut don\\'t overdo it.\\r\\nCome and see me the moment you experience\\r\\nany further system failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nI will. Thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nIn the meantime, I\\'m hoping I\\'ll find a way to\\r\\nrestore your former body.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nIs that possible?!\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nTheoretically, it might be possible to use your genetic\\r\\ninformation to regenerate your missing organs.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Linada stops herself.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinada\\r\\nSorry. It\\'s unfair for me to give you hope.\\r\\nTo be honest, there\\'s very little chance.\\r\\nBut if there\\'s even the slightest\\r\\npossibility, I have to try.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nThank you, Linada!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nFiora...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora giggles.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nDon\\'t make that face!

No problem.\\r\\nTake your time.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk goes back inside Junks, leaving Fiora alone.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nWhat can I do?\\r\\nIf I go to see Linada, she\\'ll find out\\r\\nwhat\\'s happening to my body.\\r\\nI need to come up with a good excuse.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora looks up, as if in prayer.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nPlease... Let me be with Shulk\\r\\njust a little bit longer...\\r\\n\\r\\n[Soon, Shulk and Fiora rejoin the others on the bridge of Junks.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nZanza is inside the Bionis.\\r\\nI just know it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nDickson must be there as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nYes. And Alvis too.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nThat\\'s all good, but how\\r\\ndo we get to them?\\r\\nIf they\\'re inside the Bionis,\\r\\nwe\\'re gonna need to dig a pretty big hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nHow long that take?\\r\\nRiki get old soon!\\r\\n\\r\\nMiqol\\r\\nIt just so happens I have the answer.\\r\\nOn the Bionis\\' chest is a massive\\r\\nhole that leads inside.\\r\\nIt\\'s the wound made by Egil\\'s final attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nThen that means...\\r\\n\\r\\nOtharon\\r\\nYes. While the allied force\\r\\nkeeps the Telethia busy...\\r\\nYou can sneak inside that\\r\\nwound and take out Zanza!\\r\\n\\r\\nVanea\\r\\nWe will take Junks. Let my father\\r\\nknow when you are ready to depart.\\r\\n\\r\\nReyn\\r\\nYeah! Time to knock some heads!\\r\\n\\r\\nRiki\\r\\nRiki never lose!\\r\\nFor Riki family, Riki win!\\r\\n\\r\\nDunban\\r\\nWe must show this god our\\r\\nunyielding will to survive!\\r\\n\\r\\nMelia\\r\\nThe suffering of my people will not be in vain!\\r\\n\\r\\nSharla\\r\\nThe crimes against our friends will not go unpunished!\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nShulk!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nReady.

It\\'s Lorithia! Show yourself!\\r\\n\\r\\n[The voice seems to be coming from the direction of the Bionis\\' heart.]\\r\\n\\r\\nLorithia [O.C.]\\r\\nLook at that.

Good luck!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Next, we see as Fiora arrives at Outlook Park. There, she finds Melia alone, \\r\\nlooking out across Colony 9.

Fish! Fish!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Reyn and Riki fall back into the water, with Sharla giving them a push. Then \\r\\nour perspective moves as Fiora looks up the shore, to see Shulk standing alone.\\r\\nShe walks up to him on the sand.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora [O.C.]\\r\\nHere you are!\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk turns to face us, a slight wind ruffling his hair.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora [O.C.]\\r\\nThe breeze feels so good.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Shulk turns back to the sea and nods.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nIt does.\\r\\n\\r\\n[At last, the view pans out, and we see Fiora for the first time, now back in \\r\\nher original Homs body and clothing.

It\\'s great like that.\\r\\nDon\\'t change it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Fiora sighs.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nI\\'d forgotten what it feels like to do this.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view shifts to Sharla, Juju, Reyn and Riki talking on the beach.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nI wonder what the future has in store for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nWho knows.\\r\\n\\r\\n[The view returns to Shulk and Fiora.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI\\'m sure it will be full of ups and downs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nUps and downs?\\r\\n\\r\\n[Now Juju casts a line as the three with him watch.]\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nI don\\'t know what the future holds.\\r\\nBut that means I can\\r\\nimagine the possibilities.\\r\\nWe can achieve anything we put our minds to.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Juju catches a fish and his companions react to the catch as the view returns \\r\\nto Shulk and Fiora again.]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nYeah.\\r\\nYou\\'re right!\\r\\n\\r\\nShulk\\r\\nDo you remember what the Monado,\\r\\nI mean Alvis,\\r\\nsaid to us the last time we saw him?\\r\\n\\r\\nFiora\\r\\nYes.

I can take care of myself.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"But...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"OK, I got it. I'll make you a promise. Shulk won't even get a scratch.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"A promise doesn't mean much coming from you!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"She don't trust me at all.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Nah, she doesn't mean it.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"You forgot something. You will be needing the transport cases, right?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"I'm coming along as well. I'd feel better going with you boys than sitting at home worrying about you. So, let's get moving!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I knew she didn't trust me.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Looks like it.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Are these the Mag Mell Ruins?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Haven't you been here before?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Nope.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"The Defence Force often uses it for training. But I come here to do research. It's not really a place that people go.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Not surprising. There are monsters around here that use Mechon parts as armour.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Was this built by the Mechon?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I don't think so. There's a path for people to get in. It might have been a vehicle of some kind.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Like the Defence Force hover transports?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"A vehicle? But it's so big...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's amazing technology. I wonder what kind of people made it.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I ain't got a clue.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Let's keep moving. The Ether Cylinders are up ahead.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right! Right here! Thanks for the help, Shulk. I'll start collecting them up. You two hold on a sec.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's full of Ether Cylinders... Hey, why do we have to come all the way here to get them? Isn't there an Ether Cylinder fuelling station in the colony?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Well. Refining the ether takes a long time down there, and sometimes cylinderisation fails. And there are so many cylinders here for us already. It's more reliable than making them ourselves.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right. And Colony 9's Anti-Air Batteries and mobile artillery are standardised for these cylinders, so they can be used straight away.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"I see. You know, this place is in good condition considering it's ancient.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It might be... That there's some form of technology being used to preserve it. It's just a shame we don't understand its secret.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk...?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"But I'll solve it one day and show you. If it's just technology that someone created in the past, it's not incomprehensible. We'll come to understand it one day.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Don't go trying too hard. We can come and get Ether Cylinders whenever we need them. Besides, it's a good place for Defence Force training.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah, so good that you didn't even want to come here without Shulk to back you up! Anyway, did you collect the cylinders?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yep. All done. Thanks.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Just come by yourself from now on.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shh, be quiet...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Are they Mechon?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I don't know! But it looks like we'll have to destroy them!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"In that case, just leave them to me!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora, are you OK?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"I'm fine. How about you?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I'm all right. Thanks to you and Reyn.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What on Bionis were those?! I've never seen anything like them.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Could they have been Mechon?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"No. I think they were something left by the civilisation that built this vehicle.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"They didn't seem like Mechon to me. But why did they only show up now?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I don't know. But they were probably built to protect this place. They might have been activated in response to something... But I don't think that something could have been us.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Please, let's go back. I don't wanna be here anymore.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Me neither. And we've already got the Ether Cylinders.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What's going on?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Listen. What is that?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"That sound... In the sky! It's a...!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"This can't be!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"No way!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Mechon!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"How? Didn't my brother destroy them all a year ago?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Could that defence mechanism have responded to the Mechon?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Let's get back to the colony!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Come on! They're eating people!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's horrible...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Is Dunban OK?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora! Go and check on him!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"OK!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Heads up, Reyn!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"If this thing wants a fight, let's give it one! See? Didn't stand a chance!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's not that easy! We've disabled it, but only for now. It'll reactivate soon! Where's Dunban?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"He's gone! I can't find him anywhere.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What?! He ain't fit enough to face these things!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn! Let's get to the lab!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"The lab? Of course! The Monado's there!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Exactly. The Monado can take out Mechon.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"The colonel! The guys! The colonel... The guys... I'm gonna destroy every last one of those damn Mechon!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! The entrance!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"No! We'll never get in there now...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Wait... Let me think here... Reyn, Fiora! There's still the mobile artillery!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right! If we recharge it with those Ether Cylinders we collected, we can blast our way in!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's in the Residential District!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Great!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"All right! This is it! Time to avenge the colonel and the boys! What the?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! More from behind!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn! Looks like you and I will have to cut a path through them.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Looks like it.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora! Reyn and I will open up a path. Then you can run through.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"You two can't do this by yourselves! I wanna fight as well!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Get through! We'll be right behind you!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"But Shulk...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"A year ago, Dunban and the Defence Force fought hard to protect the colony and all of us Homs. Now it's our turn to repay them!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Please, Fiora.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk... Reyn...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Don't look so worried. We'll just get rid of these ones. Shulk won't get a scratch!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"OK. I believe you.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Go now, Fiora!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Huh?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"You take care too!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Of course! Looks like she trusts me after all!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I told you. That was a close one.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You were never cut out for this stuff. You go. I'll take care of things here.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"You're too out of breath to persuade me.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Tell me about it.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn, behind you!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Get outta here, Shulk!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Don't be stupid! Hold on! The Monado!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Sorry I kept you waiting.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Dunban!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Whoa yeah! The Monado! So this is why you weren't at home. I thought so! This is what I was waiting to see!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Ready, lads?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Nice one, Dunban! You didn't waste any time on them Mechon!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! Where's Fiora?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"The Residential District... We said we'd meet her there.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Looks like we'll have to take the long way round.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"All right, then we cut through the Commercial District!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yes!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Dunban! You can't take any more of the Monado!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"But I must! I don't have a choice!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn's right. You can't go on like this.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Dunban. This time... It's my turn.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk, no! It'll kill you! Shulk!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"What's happening?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"What the?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Wow. Shulk's pretty awesome!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"How can this be? Shulk is using the Monado.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"What was that?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! More company!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn! Dunban!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I got your back!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk, do you feel all right?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I'm OK. But there was something strange. Just now, it was as if I could see into the future. Is this another power of the Monado?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"See into the future? What are ya saying?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Are you certain? Shulk!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yes.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"I see. I remember Dickson saying that the Monado had a hidden power. Could this be it?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"What?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Don't think about it now! Just believe what the Monado showed you and fight!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Got it!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's massive.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"That Mechon... It has a face?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"That don't mean nothin'!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"That's right! Not when we have the Monado! The Monado! It's not working!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Oi! What d'ya mean?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"How can that be? The Monado should cut through Mechon with ease!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"What is that light? Other Mechon don't have that. Could... Could that light be why the Monado has no effect?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! Reyn! Get down! Stay back! I'll take it from here!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"No! You can't take any more!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Everyone. Get away, right now!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"What did I just... Fiora! Get back!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"I won't let you hurt any more people! We will save Colony 9!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora! Get out of here! Run!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"You want more?! How?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora! No! I'll kill you! Die!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! Get back here!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"No! Fiora...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"The breeze feels so good.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah. I'd forgotten what it feels like. I never thought it could be so quiet here.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"You're spending too much time with Reyn. You're getting used to all the noise he makes.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah, maybe.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's so peaceful. You know, Shulk, I hope every day can be like this, always.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hey. Have you been to see Dunban?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I just can't do it. You got more guts than me.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Not at all. It was him that consoled me.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I guess that's the type of guy he is.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah. Even without the Monado, he's the strongest person I know. Uh...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk. How are you holding up?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I'm fine. But...you...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"I will shed no tears.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Huh?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"A year ago, I felt the same sense of deep loss that I do now.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"The Battle of Sword Valley.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"After that battle, many of my friends did not make it home. While I was being brought here on that stretcher, they were all I thought about. But I decided I would not cry. Everyone who died in that war had something they wanted to protect. Family, friends, loved ones, their home... So they fought to protect them. And we won. No matter how painful, no matter how hard, it's nothing to be sad about... I decided that there and then.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Dunban!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk, Fiora would tell you the same thing. She wanted to protect us. Or rather, she wanted to protect you. And you're alive now. So I will not cry.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"OK.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Remember the gift of life that Fiora gave you, and treasure it.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I...I can't say that I understand. But...I hope to, some day.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"That is all I ask.

He's one of a kind, that Dunban.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I've made a decision.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Huh?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"My purpose in life - I will pursue that faced Mechon.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"They attacked our colony, killed Fiora. I will find that Mechon - find it and destroy it. Destroy them all! What are you laughing at?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Sorry, sorry! It's just a bit weird. I never thought you'd be the one to say it!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"So you agree?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"'Course, man. I'm just surprised you came out with it first!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"You thought I'd try and talk you out of it! 'That's not what Fiora would want!' That sound right?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah. Something like that. I thought you'd give me a hard time.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"In my head, there are two versions of me. One of them is saying that. It's telling me, 'Listen to what Dunban said.'\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What about the other one?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It keeps shouting, 'Make them pay!' 'Destroy every single one of them!' And it won't stop getting louder.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"That doesn't sound like you. Sure it ain't my voice in there?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Might be! It's a bit of a loudmouth!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"There you go then! So when are we heading off?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right now.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Perfect. Right then.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Look after yourselves, boys. As soon as this heals, I'll be right behind you. And then we will seize our destiny. Together.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's all very well going after that metal-faced Mechon. But shouldn't we have some kind of plan?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"How about checking out Colony 6?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Colony 6... The only other Homs colony left.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Colony 6 is on the way to Sword Valley, where there's supposed to be a Mechon base. If that's where they came from, maybe the people in Colony 6 saw something.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Good point. They might even know something about that metal-faced Mechon. So we go past the Mag Mell Ruins and up through Tephra Cave. Then we should arrive at the Bionis' knee.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah. And if we can get to the knee, it ain't far to Colony 6, right?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Sounds like a plan! Let's head to Colony 6. This door... It was closed when we came past before, but it's open now.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Maybe it was programmed to open up in case of Mechon emergency. The way to the Bionis' knee is just ahead. You ready?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah, let's go. An ether lamp.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Don't traders use these things as guideposts?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah. We can follow them to the Bionis' knee.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"OK. But if armed traders need guideposts, it must be pretty dangerous in here. Let's keep our wits about us.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Definitely. What the...?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Look at the emblem. They're traders from Colony 6. No wonder it's been so long since the last delivery.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn, their injuries...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"They weren't made by no Mechon. It was probably the monsters that live here. Man, that's grim. I don't wanna go like this. Not even killed by Mechon, just some monsters in a cave.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"They probably had families...children...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Maybe. It wouldn't surprise me. But why do you say that?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"No reason. Reyn, shouldn't we return them to the Bionis?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Oh, right. What's born from the Bionis is returned to the Bionis. That's the way of the Homs. That was way harder than I thought it'd be. I'm just about ready to collapse!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Let's take a rest. If the monsters in here killed all these traders, we need to be at our best. I'm wide awake, so I'll take first watch.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Thanks, man. The nap'll do me good. Shulk. My turn.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Awake already?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Didn't sleep a wink. And I still feel like I just did one of Vangarre's drills!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Heh.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hey... Why do you think the Mechon attacked? Are we just food to them? Or, what, did we do something wrong? Sort of reminds me of the battle between the Bionis and the Mechonis. I wonder if it's anything to do with that?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Well... It's hard to believe that living things are just a source of energy for machines. There has to be another reason.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"The Mechon killed Fiora.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You know what? I'll never forgive 'em. I don't care what their reason is.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hmm. When it happened, the Monado showed me that Fiora was in danger. But I couldn't save her.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's not your fault. Just 'cos the Monado showed you some future, that don't mean you could do anything about it. You did great. You fought them off. I couldn't have done that. You know, I've been thinking about it. Why you can use the Monado, I mean. Dickson told me. You're a survivor from the Monado expedition team that went out 14 years ago. There was a blizzard or something and your mum and dad died. And then Dickson found you and brought you back.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"That sounds right. I was pretty young, so I don't really remember anything.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Is that why you do it? Why you're always helping Dickson with his research and trying to figure out the Monado?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Maybe. Part of me does see it as something to remind me of my mum and dad. But mainly, if it really is the sword that the Bionis used to kill the Mechonis, like in the legend... I want to work out its secret. That's the real reason.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I've got it! You were chosen. By the Monado.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"What? Chosen?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Don't you see? Not even Dunban can handle it. It ain't chance that you can and he can't. I'll take the next watch. You get some rest.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"OK, I'll try. Night, Reyn. I... The True Monado?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! Shulk!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! Shulk!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What're ya playing at?! Give us a hand!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I'm sorry, Reyn.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Don't worry about it. It looked like you were having a nightmare!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Really? The True Monado? Was I dreaming?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What's with you? We'd better get a move on.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It wasn't a dream. Was it a vision? What should I do? I could tell Reyn. But... I don't know...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What on Bionis are those?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Monsters' egg sacs...I think... But it looks like there are Mechon parts inside as well.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Man... What kind of monsters are they?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Probably some type of Arachno... Reyn! Get back!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Argh! Urgh! Ahh!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn! No! If that vision comes true, then Reyn...! I've gotta find him!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You things just don't give up, do ya?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn! I've gotta hurry. If I can get up there, I should be able to reach him.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! Where are ya?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn! Reyn!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"There's too many of 'em! I kill one, and ten more pop up!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn! No! Not that way! Reyn!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What's this?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"The power of the Monado?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Look out!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Glad one of us figured out these things would try an ambush. Let's do this, Shulk!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Looks like the Monado works on more than just Mechon. I gotta say, that's pretty awesome!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn... I just realised something.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Huh?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"The future I see... It isn't set. I think it's more like a warning.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"A warning?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah... A warning about what will happen. What will happen if I don't do anything, or if I can't do anything. So I can use this power to change the future. And that's exactly what I intend to do.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You've got my vote. And if you really can do that... I think Fiora would have liked it too.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right, let's get moving. We're nearly at the Bionis' knee.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Wow!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"No matter how many times I see this, I never get used to it.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"On the other side of those clouds...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yep. It's our enemy. Mechonis.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Our enemy...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"If we just came up the Bionis' shin...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Then this must be its kneecap, right?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yup. Which means Colony 6 is up ahead!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Looks like we can climb up there.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Great! I love a good climb. Shulk! Look over there.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Smoke...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Maybe someone's got a fire going. Hope they're cooking up something good!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's hardly a good spot for a barbecue! Come on, let's take a look.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Someone's left a buggy out here.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"That's strange. Who would just abandon a buggy in this place? And it's pretty new.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Is it brand new?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Not brand new. But it's in very good condition. You wouldn't just abandon it. So what did happen to the driver? There's a boy! He's being attacked by monsters!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You saw it happening? Where?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I don't know! But it was near some water.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Near water... But what made you have a vision all of a sudden?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Maybe it was triggered by touching the buggy.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Well, we'd better find him. Let's search everywhere round here where there's water!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"OK!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! Over there! You all right, kid? That can wait. Go! Get outta here! Leave these guys to us.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Let's do this!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Ready when you are!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"OK. It should work now. I fixed the circuit, but it's out of ether. Change the cylinder and it'll be as good as new.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I think it's time for the introductions. I'm Reyn. He's Shulk.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Pleased to meet you. Your camp?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"How about it?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Let's take him up on the offer. I'm surprised there's a Homs camp here, but they might have some information.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I suppose.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Juju, can you tell us how to get there?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Then what? Got it. Now, let's make a move.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"That gear. You must be survivors from the Defence Force! Is Colony 6 OK? Did Gadolt make it?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hold on. What're you talking about?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"We've come from Colony 9.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Colony 9? Oh, so you're not from Colony 6. Thank you for helping Juju. I'm his sister, Sharla. Did you now? Well, all right. I suppose that's only fair.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Did something happen? To Colony 6?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Actually, we're heading there ourselves.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Colony 6 has been... Our home! It's been occupied by the Mechon. I'll tell you about it inside. Follow me. We had already fought off the Mechon a year ago, at the Battle of Sword Valley. It left us with a false sense of security. The Colony 6 Defence Force didn't even notice the approaching Mechon. By the time the air-raid siren sounded, a swarm of Mechon had blackened the sky. They ate people and burned our buildings. Me and Juju dedicated ourselves to evacuating the children and elderly. I don't know what happened next.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's just like what happened to Colony 9.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"They attacked your colony as well?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yes. It's good that you managed to evacuate so many.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"We have Otharon...the Colonel... to thank for that. Him and Gadolt.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"This Gadolt...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"He would have been my husband by now if not for all this. Cheer up, you two!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Er...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"We can't lose hope just yet! I'm certain Gadolt and the other soldiers are alive. They're still fighting. I can feel it.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hmm?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You bet! We're up for some revenge. I bet we can even get your colony back!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"There you go showing off again...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Juju! The people here need us! How many times do I have to tell you? Even if that's true... No, especially if it's true! We cannot expose the camp to any more danger.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Kid! You oughta know how Sharla feels. Watch your mouth and have some respect! Maybe I was too hard on him. Shulk?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn, you really remind me of Gadolt when you get angry.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I do?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Gadolt's taken care of us ever since we were young. I always saw him as a big brother really, but he was more of a father to Juju... He'd call him 'kid' whenever he told him off, just like you did.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I don't think I'm ready to be someone's old man just yet... Shulk? Did it happen again?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You had another vision?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Oh no!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"No! Juju! The buggy's gone! He's going to Colony 6 on his own!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Stupid kid!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"We have to hurry. Something bad's gonna happen.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What did you see?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"A deep valley... Everything's engulfed in flames... There's a black shadow... It kills Juju.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Is it the Mechon with the metal face?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Where does it happen? Is it near Colony 6?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I'm not sure. I think so.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Let's get after him, Shulk!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hold on a second! What was all that about?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I know you won't believe this... but Shulk can see the future.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"The future? That's not possible.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"That's what I thought too. I still can't explain this. But that vision will come true unless we stop it.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"So you're telling me Juju's in danger?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Believe it or don't believe it, that's your call. But I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for Shulk's visions.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Juju... OK. I can't say I believe you. But what have I got to lose?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I like the way you think!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Sharla, you're...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"What?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"No, nothing.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What are you doing? Let's go and find Juju!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"When you talk like that you sound just like Gadolt! That's how I know it's not worth arguing.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What am I, some kind of Gadolt substitute?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"That thing kills Sharla too. I saw it in the vision. But I can't stop her coming with us. I don't know how I can protect her. But I have to do it. I WILL change the future.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Sharla, do you know which way Juju went?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"There are quite a few ways to get there from here, but he's in a buggy, so I think he'll take Raguel Bridge.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Raguel Bridge?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's not far. It's a really old bridge. Built around the time Colony 9 was founded.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"OK. Let's make that our next stop.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Sounds like a plan! Sharla, you stay back. Leave any monsters up to me and Shulk.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"What, you think I can't pull my weight in battle? I've got field experience as a medic. If you get hurt, I can use ether to patch you up.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Nice! I'm always getting roughed up. You'll be a big help! Hey, Sharla! Look!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's Juju's buggy!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Juju!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What is it?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's Juju!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! Is he OK?! Tell me!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"There's a Mechon... It's taken Juju!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"When?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I'm not sure. But I don't think we've got much time.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"You said you saw a deep valley, didn't you?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yes.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"There's a place like that just up ahead. And it's even on the way to Colony 6. That must be the route Juju's taking.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You sure? No other deep valleys round here?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Not as far as I know.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Well, Shulk?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Let's move. That has to be where Juju is.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Is this the place you were on about?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"This is it all right. At the end of the road there's a path to Colony 6.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"But there's no sign of Juju. If my vision was right, he should be around here somewhere.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"I'm sure he would have gone along this road. I just hope nothing's happened to him yet.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Any chance he went up that way?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's not safe around here. I doubt Juju would go off the beaten track if he could avoid it.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Got it. We'll search along the road.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Juju! Juju! Hold on, I'm coming!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Wait! Sharla!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Juju!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Another new symbol's appeared on the Monado! Can I save her?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Its tentacles could come out from under the ground at any second. One false move and you're done for. Wait for my order! Reyn, you got my back?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"'Course! Leave it to me!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Amazing! I didn't know you could do that!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's not me. It's the power of the Monado.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"That's right. And the light swirling around us... That's the Monado 'n' all. Sharla! Let's move! Is it down?! Get back here!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's up there! Let's go after it!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Juju! Are you all right?! I'm so glad you're OK.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hey! Looks like we changed the future! What's up?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Well, it's just that... That can't have been the Mechon from my vision.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah, weren't it supposed to be that one with the face. I guess we changed more than we expected! Shulk?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"No. Something's not right.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Juju!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"No! It's not him at all!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"But this one's got a face 'n' all!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"What? It spoke! Juju!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Juju!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You pile of junk! Let him go!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn! Better watch your back!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Got it! Cheers, Shulk!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Why? Why can't I use the Monado?! It's only the ones that have faces. But... I can still see what it's going to do! Just like before!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! Leave these to me! Go take him out!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Got it!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Now!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right! It's just bouncing off 'im! Shulk! Look out! You! You're gonna pay!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Juju... Gadolt! Otharon. But... Promise me.

Where are you?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hey there. Are you all right?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"The sleeping princess awakes.

We want a piece of them too.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Really...?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Truth be told, we were gonna leave without you.

And it's just... I never imagined I would go back to Colony 6 like this. I'm sorry. Lost myself for a minute. We can get to Colony 6 from the valley where Juju was taken. It's this way.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"This is Colony 6?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's like a fortress.

We can't just rush in.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"We could enter through the mine.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Mine?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"There's a massive ether deposit under the colony. The first settlers here built right on top of the mine. That's how we got our colony. The mine is like a network of tunnels. It's much more complicated than the colony streets. They can't have figured it all out in the space of a month.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"So...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"She means it's the best route if we want to remain unseen.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"You're catching on.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Great! So how do we get in?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Through the Drainage Outlet. It's just up ahead. Guys! Kill the noise.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"A Mechon.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"I can't believe they've taken the mine too!

I get the idea.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I ain't done yet! You're useless on your own, Shulk. That's why we're here.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn, I...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Next time you have a vision, you tell us.

I believe in you.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Thanks. They're right. We'll change what happens. Anyway, I didn't see Juju and the others dying. There's still hope.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"We're here. The Central Pit.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Where are they all?

But let's see if you can block this!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"You OK, Dunban?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"What are you? That light... Everyone! Fall back, now!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Now's our chance!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"We must be outside the tower.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"What or who are you?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"You will pay for what you've done! You will know the pain and suffering you caused the Emperor and Fiora! Another one... You're not getting away!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Get back here!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk, Reyn, let it go!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You've got to be kidding!

Whatever it was.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Wait... Dickson? Dunban? You're the heroes who risked your lives a year ago, in the battle to defend the colonies.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Dunban, Dickson, thanks for helping out back there.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"I don't believe we did anything.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"What was that thing?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"A Telethia. So that's what it's called.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"A mystical beast that protects the Bionis.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"So, what's your plan from here? Follow that metal-faced machine, I presume?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What else? He's gonna pay for what he did to Fiora.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Well then. There's only one place he'd go. Galahad Fortress in Sword Valley. A year ago, those things were building a huge fortress, right in the valley. Tactically, it's an excellent location to launch attacks from. I feel there's a strong chance they've now finished building it. That would explain why both colonies were attacked recently.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"So it's settled. Bash down a fortress and smash some metal brains!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Easy, Reyn.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"There's somewhere else I need to go first.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"But what could be more important than... Wait... You saw another one.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I was somewhere very high up. I was fighting at the peak of a huge tower. Fighting Metal Face. I heard a voice, and then the Monado's power was unleashed. His armour instantly gave way. The Monado doesn't work on Metal Face at the moment, but if that vision comes true...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Can you remember anything else from your vision?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I remember a huge horn. That's it! As I fought Metal Face, I could see the Bionis' head.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Prison Island?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"The High Entia are real? I thought they were a myth!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"The High Entia? I'd dismissed them as folklore as well.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Have you ever met one?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Wow! Dickson, man, you're just full of surprises!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Stop your whining. You do it 'cos you enjoy it. And you make a tidy profit. Well then, Shulk, what's it to be?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"We'll head there.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"There are alternatives. We could abandon the colonies, find a place the Mechon will not discover and live in secret.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I realised something when we were fighting Xord. Wherever we go, they'll follow. We can't run from these things. We must fight on.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"I see. Then I am obliged to join you.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"You want to come with us?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Scared I'll get hurt?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"No way! We know you're stronger than anything! Right, Reyn?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You bet!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"I've recovered a great deal since we last met. And that miserly old coot over there made me this. Sharp, light. Perfect for cutting through steel. Show me a Mechon and I'll slice it in two. I might not be in peak condition, but I'm useful.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I can't thank you enough.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"We're in it together now.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"You can count on us, Dunban.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"So you keep saying... We're at the bottom, so I guess the only way to go is up.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"The lower back... I've never seen anywhere like this!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Wow... I've never thought about going inside the Bionis.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"You really know all the fun spots, eh, Dickson?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"We'll push on. No matter what.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Everyone, look. It's a group of Nopon.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What d'ya think they're up to?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"They must be here for a reason. Let's go and ask them.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Good idea. This lamp... It has a very strange glow.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Good for them.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"The breeze feels so good. It's so peaceful. You know, Shulk, I hope every day can be like this, always.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"You will pay for what you've done! You will know the pain and suffering you caused the Emperor and Fiora! Dickson. I owe it all to you. If you hadn't found me that day, I wouldn't be here now, discovering the world. Don't be. I don't remember much at all. But I know that my mum and dad left me it. The Monado was their final gift to me. At least, that's how I used to think of it. That's why I wanna discover its true power and help defeat the Mechon. But so far I've just been creating piles of Mechon scrap. This sword... There must be some way... Sorry, guys. Didn't sleep a wink.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right then. Time to move on. How far now?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I understand. Thank you for everything. No, it's OK.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"I want to help Shulk. The Mechon must pay for what they did. And I'm sure Gadolt is still alive somewhere. If he is, I have to find him. Are you sure?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"No way, kid! You just need to shape up like me! You'll do us proud, kid.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Good luck, Juju. Dickson, are you leaving too? Yeah, I guess you're really needed at the colony. You can bet on it! We won't let the colony down.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Thanks for the heads-up, Dickson. The lift don't work!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Looks like it's been broken for a while. We'll have to find another way up.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Another way? You don't mean climb up there?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"We may have to.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Come on, you can't be serious? Why'd someone build a lift that don't work?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"No complaining! Let's start looking for a place we can climb up. Reyn...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Ready to go, Shulk?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah. But just hold on a minute.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"What is it, Shulk?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's about the Monado. I'd like to ask your permission to use it a little longer.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Why ask me?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"The Monado was your sword. But...I need it to achieve my goal. So...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Don't sweat it. You are far more skillful at wielding that thing than I ever was. Keep it. It's yours. Besides, I have a new sword. That old coot had the decency to forge this one for me. I owe it to him to make the most of it!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Dunban...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"You've fought your way this far.

This Prison Island Shulk saw in his vision isn't getting any closer.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"What is this place?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's giving me the creeps.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"At a guess, I'd say we're inside the Bionis. What is it, Shulk?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Nothing. It's just that... It feels like the Bionis isn't really dead.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Wait a minute, Shulk. If the Bionis starts moving around, things won't look good for us! Let's just keep moving.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"No, Aizel.

I'll carry her.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"She hasn't sustained any serious injuries, but her condition is far from stable.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Do you know what's wrong with her?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Her symptoms suggest ether deficiency. It's well-known that Homs are strongly affected by ether levels in the environment. But I've never seen symptoms like this before.

And now we know there is another who can use the Monado.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"I can't wait to meet him.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"So you weren't just having a sneaky nap then?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"No!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I'm just saying. You and Dunban are the only ones I know that can wield the Monado. How would this guy know how?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"OK. Locked and loaded. Everyone, stand back.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Wow. Unbelievable.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"She's coming round. All thanks to our medic.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Are you OK?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Where am I?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Everything's fine. You're gonna be...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Get your hands off me!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hey, watch it!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Forgive me. I did not mean to...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Sorry if we surprised you.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Are you the ones who helped me?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Well, something like that.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Excuse me. My name is Melia. Forgive my indiscretion. I have not had the pleasure of coming into contact with a male Homs.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Coming into contact?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hey Shulk. You're creeping this lady out.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shut up, Reyn!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"This large one is far worse.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Me?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Melia, is it? How did you get here, then? What, is there no one with you?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"I must apologise, but my situation does not concern you. And I shall not be divulging anything to common passers-by.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Duly noted, your ladyship. But if I were to be so bold, I'm guessing that you didn't come here alone and you weren't just taking an afternoon nap.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"And what, may I ask, are you doing here? It is rare to see Homs venture this deep into Makna Forest.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"We're travelling to the head of the Bionis. We've got a long journey ahead of us.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"The head of the Bionis?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"We were just figuring out how to get there when we found you.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"I see. Then permit me to return the favour by aiding you in your quest.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Really?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"There is only one path to the head of the Bionis. It is the path that leads to Eryth Sea.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"So this Eryth Sea is at the head of the Bionis?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"If you would be kind enough to escort me out of the forest, I will show you the way.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"You'd do that?! Thank you, Melia! I'm Shulk. Pleased to meet you.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk, ah yes. Likewise.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"She's a bit high and mighty, but she's a Homs too, right? Why is she here alone?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Ain't got a clue. Ask her yourself. I'm not good with her posh accent.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"We shall travel to the Nopon village.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Nopon village?! That's where we've been heading. We reckon it's our best chance of making it to the top.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Since inhabiting the region, the Nopon have been a great help. You can travel to Eryth Sea from their village.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's settled. We'll make our way to the Nopon village.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Very well. The Nopon inhabit a giant tree. If we follow this trail, we will be safe. This is the entrance to Frontier Village.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"So this big tree is where the Nopon live?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"I wish to speak with the village chief. Will you permit us to enter? I shall take you to the village chief. Follow me. Nopon of Frontier Village! Melia Antiqua has returned. I request an audience with your chief. Chief, will you hear my request?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Bird Lady?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"They are at one with the Bionis. They sacrificed their lives so that I might escape. But this is not my reason for coming. These Homs need your help. Will you be so kind as to listen to their request? They require safe passage to Eryth Sea. I have unfinished business in this region. Once these Homs are safely on their way, I shall be on mine as well.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"That girl...something's troubling her.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"We found her half-dead and all alone. But I don't suppose she'll tell us the reason any time soon.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Maybe we can help. I'll go and talk to her. Melia. You're welcome to come with us. Is it true? Were you alone in the forest?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"That thing must be stopped by my hand. This is my pledge to those that have died.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Wounded by a girl... You don't mean you're going to fight the Telethia?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"How do you know of the Telethia?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"When I went to collect the ether crystals, some Telethia attacked me. I managed to destroy them and get away.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"You defeated Telethia?! Who are you? The Monado... So that sword can...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"To tell the truth, they were the Telethia's spawn. Someone told me the primary Telethia is healing somewhere in the forest. It was you, wasn't it? You hurt the Telethia. Melia?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"The Telethia escaped from our homeland, and I am tasked with killing it. It cannot remain free.

I...I want...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Speak, Shulk. Or I shall be forced to summon the Nopon chief to interpret for me.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I would like to help.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"What could you possibly gain from aiding me?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I saw it. At the top of a black tower, you and I were fighting together. Fighting that faced Mechon. I also saw you fighting a huge Telethia.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"It threw me the first time 'n' all.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Forgive me, Shulk, but what are you talking about?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk can see visions of the future.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"See the future?! And you expect me to believe this rubbish?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Believe what you want, lady. Same as I tell all the non-believers.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"That'll be me then.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Oh yeah. In any case, the only reason we got this far was 'cos of Shulk's visions. If Shulk says he saw you in a vision, then you must be important to whatever happens next. And if you're tough enough to fight a faced Mechon, you're all right in my book.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"You've got my vote. A lady should not go unaccompanied onto the battlefield.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Excuse me! I am quite capable of dispatching the beast alone! I require no assistance of any kind! Chief Dunga, I...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You do know we're listening? A Nopon hero? Now this I have to see!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Don't be like that. Let's meet him first.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Watch out!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Get off me!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"To you!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right in the... Take this, furball!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"New Hom Hom friends! Meet this year's legendary Heropon, Riki! Riki live to serve!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"A Heropon, you say? Not sure where you'll come in handy, but the more the merrier. Shulk, are these Telethia as strong as they sound?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yes. They're quick as lightning and can read your mind.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"A mind-reading giant bird. No problem.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I can see their movement through the Monado, but even that's not enough to get the better of them.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"And we're going up against the daddy version. No one blink for a second.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"OK.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Eyes wide open!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"And don't forget that Melia is our only chance of making it to Eryth Sea. If anything happens to our guide, it's on our heads. The Telethia is our target, but don't forget about the person standing next to you.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Dunban's right.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"I am in your debt. My weaknesses are all too apparent.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"No worries, Melia!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Riki's friends, listen to Riki! Dinobeast is big and scary! Friends get ready, friends help Riki get ready!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"You want us to get equipment for you?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Riki's friend right. Hom Hom clever! Friends meet Riki when ready. Then friends and Riki leave together.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Big attitude for a furry footrest. \\\"Dinobeast is big and scary!\\\" Great. That'll come in handy.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Is it just me or did we suddenly become Nopon mercenaries?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Ready to go! Come new friends, Riki's adventure begins!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Riki? You do know where the Telethia is, don't you?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Of course Riki know! Melly! Riki hear you hurt Dinobeast!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"I did. But only a little.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"When Dinobeast hurt, Riki know it go to place with ether crystals. Friends and Riki go to place with crystals. Then we find Dinobeast! Chief tell Riki! Chief always right!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"So you do know a thing or two about this monster. Guess we'll be searching for some ether crystals then.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Riki? Why are you the Heropon?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Why? Because Chief Dunga choose Riki!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"He chose you? So you weren't chosen from birth?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Friend wrong. Chief choose by instinct!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"By instinct?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Why friend surprised? Chief have sharp instinct. Chief be village seer!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"So that's how you became the Heropon? Can't argue with that.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"But he is kind of...compact...for a warrior hero.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Riki owe lots of monies to village. If Riki defeat Dinobeast, village promise to forget my debts. So Riki like being Heropon! What is this? Riki never see before! This not Riki's Makna! Riki never see before!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"To think it has caused this much damage.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"What do you mean?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Are you telling me the Telethia did this?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Telethia absorb and drain the surrounding area of all its ether.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"That's it! The Telethia is sucking up all the ether, which is causing the natural environment to change.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk, the Telethia can read your mind. Expect it to know what you will do before you do it.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I know. I'll aim for its antenna and stop its ability to read my thoughts. With the Monado at our side, it doesn't stand a chance.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"It is much more powerful than its offspring. Do not expect it to fall so easily.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I won't. But we have to trust in the Monado.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk has only met Telethia once, and they were merely the spawn. So why is he so sure of himself?

I see...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Stick together everyone.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Dinobeast! Big as Riki imagined!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"The Telethia! I take this chance to bring vengeance for my brethren and fulfil my duty! Shulk!

She's nifty with that staff.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"I knew it.

Protect Melia at all costs!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"On it!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"What the?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Dinobeast grown back thing!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"You've got to be kidding me!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's no good.

I can tell they were dear to you. I know only too well that desire for revenge. And the crushing pain of losing those close to you. I can't stand by and let another person experience what I have. This monster is going down! I'll trap him with the Monado! Then the rest of you, hit the Telethia with everything you have!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Thank you.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Ready?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Riki!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Now!

Finish him!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Brilliant thinking. Even though the Telethia can absorb large amounts of ether energy and regenerate at an incredible rate...

I thank you for your aid in my cause. Justice has been served.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"You're welcome. Besides, it was mostly you.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Dinobeast! Heropon Riki ready for round two! Hey! Fight over already? No!

Riki, what on Bionis is going on?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Friends, meet Riki wifeypon and littlepon.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You have got to be joking!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Wife and children?!

Not fair if you ask me.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Chief Dunga. Will you kindly grant these Homs passage to Eryth Sea? It is my promise to them. You are too kind.

Then we need not search at all.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"So you've heard of it?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Heard of it? I have seen it. A dark tower at the head of the Bionis. Only one place fits that description.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"So you know it?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"I believe what you saw was Prison Island.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Prison Island. Dickson said the same thing.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Indeed. Melia, have you ever been there?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"I have not set foot upon the island, but I know of it. Prison Island is sealed. No one may enter without imperial sanction.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Imperial sanction? That means we'll be needing someone to grant us entry. I've heard that Eryth Sea is home to an empire ruled by the High Entia. They might be our best chance.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"You are knowledgable for a Homs.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Sanctions, empires? Anyone help here?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"A sanction is permission from someone important. An empire must be a place ruled by an Emperor. In other words, we need an Emperor's permission to enter the island.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"This Emperor... Is he important?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Long before we Homs built the colonies... A group of so-called royal-types or imperials ruled our lands. Think of them like the heads of our colony. But with much greater influence and power.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Now I get it. Dunban knows more than a textbook!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Are you kidding? That's first year Homs history, Reyn!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"I might have slept through that class...

Forget it.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"First we must travel to the imperial capital.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"We'll see how easy it is to see this Emperor.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"My promise was to be your guide. I will not break it.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Melia, isn't that the...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"The shortcut to Eryth Sea, yes.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What is it?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Friends, jump in ball! All go to Eryth!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Jump? In that? You're nuts, furball!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"You have nothing to fear.

Haven't decided yet.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Is something wrong?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Aren't you curious... About why we're going to Prison Island, I mean?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"It is not common for Homs to visit this region. You may have good reason, but forgive me. I do not pry into other people's business.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's definitely bugging her, Shulk.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"How dare you! You clown!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's OK, Melia. We're not strangers anymore.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Well, I... You are right.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"So then you'll listen to our story?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yes.

I had heard about the Mechon assault on the lower regions, but did not know the situation was so grave. How lucky we are...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hey, what's that?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Is that...?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"You are looking at Prison Island.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"So that's Prison Island...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yes.

The two fought and died, killing many creatures in the process. Their remains became our worlds, bringing forth new life on Bionis. That's how we were made. Alvis told me the same thing. But why is this happening now? We used it because we- You're talking about total extinction. Then you'll help us? Your Majesty, we need imperial sanction to enter Prison Island. Will you permit us entry? I saw it in a vision. We will fight a faced Mechon. They must pay for what they did. Is it connected to the awakening of the Bionis? I understand. This is not our homeland.

We've come too far to give up now!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Then we'll go to Mechonis! And find Fiora!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yes. We will get Fiora back.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Whoa! What the?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Is all that big sword? If is then ouchy ouch!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"The sword of the Mechonis.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"The entire valley below... The whole thing is its sword!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Something seems unnatural.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"What do you mean?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Look. That flowing light. From the way it glows, it has to be ether. But it looks like it's being drawn in by something.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"By the fortress! It should just be up ahead.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Father once told me that the Mechonis absorbs the ether of the Bionis and uses it for sustenance.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"So the Mechonis feeds off ether. Then undoubtedly the ether serves as the Mechon's energy source as well.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"It looks so big, even from this distance. The fortress must be enormous.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Galahad Fortress - the front line base of the Mechon. The Mechon that attack Bionis must all come from here.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Then there's a high probability that he's there. The golden Mechon that took Fiora. We're about to enter the Mechon stronghold. If there's anyone who wants to turn back now...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk. Friend should no split up. No leave friend behind. Riki scared but Riki want go too.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Riki.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"He's right. OK, let's go.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yes!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"What's that?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"You arranged this for us?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hey, it's...!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Dickson!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"What are you doing here?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah! I was hoping for some new stuff!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"You cheap old man! Yes. They made Mumkhar into one. He was the one who attacked Colony 9. Aren't you surprised?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Sorry? Thanks for coming this far. We'll be fine. We can handle ourselves.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Agreed. We will infiltrate via the ether inlets. If I'm right and the Mechon do feed off ether... Then we're sure to find some form of influx channel. Our objective is to reach one of those channels.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I won't! You take care as well.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Looks like it's just us.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right!

Don't be so sure you can take us all on by yourself!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"What's that sound?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You scumbag!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's just like with Zanza!

So of course I want to get my revenge!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"But... Face Mechon are not like the others. They're people! Like us! Are you really willing to kill another Homs?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yes. Sometimes needs must!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Even if it's Fiora? What then? When we set out, I wanted to destroy all Mechon. That was my aim. But now... I know that there are people inside. I have to know why. What's the reason for all of this? Why do Bionis and Mechonis have to keep on fighting? I have to find out why!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"So, that is your fight?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Dunban!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"I will never forgive what he's done.

You went too far, you fool.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"At least he's out of the way.

Fiora!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! What's up?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Did you see something?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"No...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"You did see something.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"All right. It was the silver Mechon... Fiora. She's definitely inside the fortress.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"All right. At least we know what to expect.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"So Fiora is inside. I can't let that vision come true. I have to save her!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Here's our way in.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"There's no turning back.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"We can't let them find us. Let's move!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora's in here somewhere.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Let's get looking. Keep your eyes peeled. I'm ready for anything. I'll trash any Mechon that tries to mess with us! Where are we?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Looks like the control room for an ether blast furnace. There, look at that.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"So this is what supplies the Mechon with ether energy.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! What's that?! Looks like fun! Riki want to ride!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"We didn't come here to mess about, furball! Time to bounce on!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hold on! If we can stop that piston, we might be able to shut down the blast furnace.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Nice idea. Cut off the Mechon's ether supply.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Riki say we try!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah, but how are we supposed to stop something that massive?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"If we can stop the turbines driving the piston, it should work. And the turbines should be nearby.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Right. Let's search for them.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Nice one! We did it!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"This should prevent them from mobilising any large Mechon squads for now. Hopefully we've improved the allied force's chances.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hold steady, my brother.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Friends! Here here!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It looks like the door's been unlocked.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Nice. Let's get down to the blast furnace.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"If we're lucky, Fiora might be down there.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk, is that?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Riki would say: \", \"completion\": \"Spear ones! Loads and loads of spear Mechon!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's Fiora!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Stop! Don't you recognise Shulk?! Fiora!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora. Please. Don't you remember us at all?!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's no use. Everyone, it's time to retreat.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Got it!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Understood.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Move! Shulk! You all right?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yeah, I think so. What do we do now, Shulk? We ain't gonna last long here!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora! Try and remember! It's us! What is...?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Oi, what's going on?!

Wait here!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora! Stop this right now. How could you? Shulk came here to save you! Do you hear me? Fiora!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"You must run.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora! Fiora...

But what about Fiora?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"If we die here today, she will be... She will be lost forever.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"You chunk of scrap! So it was you who did that to the Monado!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"But how can you... Never! If the Monado really is powerless, then why would you want it for yourself? I'll never give it to you! Never!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Egil! I cannot allow this. That boy is at risk. Shulk! Don't let him die! Help Shulk! Help them! Who are you?! Whoever you are... Please lend me your strength!

Survive!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Not good! Let's get out of here!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! Where are you?! Shulk, get back here!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora... Fiora!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Shulk! No!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It's been a long time since I last had this dream.

She needs water. Fiora. You're awake. Do you remember? My name is Shu-\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"I can't believe it.

I never forgot you, or the others.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Then, why?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Because I wasn't me anymore.

The one who was controlling the Mechon you were in?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yes, that voice. But I could still see and hear. I was there all the time.

He's massive...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"We were told that you were waiting for us.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Melia would say: \", \"completion\": \"Request?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"It is.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Yes.

From what you've told us, I would've thought you'd want us to destroy the Bionis rather than kill your own son.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"So he wants to do to us what the Bionis did to the Machina?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Didn't you ever try to stop him?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Where is Egil now?

You don't feel any sympathy at all?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Reyn would say: \", \"completion\": \"All I know is, this stinks. Who cares what he's been through?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Reyn!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"I understand about Egil. But why us?

Please!\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"That's OK. I don't want to be a burden to Shulk. I don't care if I have a machine body. Just make it so I can fight beside him.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"Fiora...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"A problem? But where? We'll take a look. The beach at the base of Digit 5, right? I think we found it. Is this the Piezoelectric Unit? Linada, will Fiora be OK now? But! You're right. I'll try and get some rest. Thank you for everything you're doing. Yes? I'll go and see him. He wants Egil stopped, and so do we. But I need to sleep on it. Thank you. Umm... Yes, very well. I wanted to...talk about your son. Yes. We agree with you. Egil must be stopped. But we can't act now. Before we came here, we heard of plans to form an allied force on Bionis. Any day now they're going to launch an attack on Mechonis. But it's too dangerous. Egil has made a weapon that could kill us all.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"The weapon that Mumkhar was using? The one that shoots green fluid?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Sharla would say: \", \"completion\": \"He said it can decompose any being from Bionis.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"We have to go back and warn them.

I wondered where you were getting it from.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"I haven't discovered why, but it disintegrates anything it touches.

Let me think about it for a bit. Fiora. Dickson, listen. Yes. What are you fighting for, Dickson? Because he's trying to exterminate the Homs? Really? Will they launch an attack on Mechonis? Prince Kallian said that? Yeah. I think that's the type of man he is. We're going to the Mechonis capital. I don't know. I can't forgive the Mechon for what they've done. But after listening to Miqol, I think there might be another way. Do you really think that?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"We won't let Shulk die.

Yes. Thank you for all your help.\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Fiora would say: \", \"completion\": \"Vanea...\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"Is she a Machina as well?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Dunban would say: \", \"completion\": \"Hold on. You mean she's Egil's sister?\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Shulk would say: \", \"completion\": \"And you say she'll help us? I dunno why she'd help us, but...

Now, let's even the odds a bit! Dickson, Mumkhar. Let's do this! What does it look like? I'm still good to go! Mumkhar?! What are you doing?! That way is- Dickson, take care of the survivors. Vile Mechon! If you think the Homs, the people of Bionis, are just waiting here for you to pick us off... You are sorely mistaken!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A Mechon M71! I bet I can use its optical system to align one of the Anti-Air Batteries. No good. It's broken. The joint section. It's buckled. It's completely useless. An M69! Its armour would be perfect for making a shield. If I can just get it off, I should be able to...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn! It's not a Mechon! It's just a Krabble! It was using the Mechon armour as a shell!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'll lure it away and Topple it! When it's down, use your Arts to finish it off!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thanks, Reyn. That was a close one.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Man, what were you doing wandering off by yourself? Stay where I can keep an eye on you. It's pretty dangerous outside of the colony. There are all kinds of monsters.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. But thanks to you, we got its shell. Everyone in the colony's gonna be really happy.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm more worried about you than the shell. Ah...whatever. Knowing what you're like, at least you'll make a decent weapon out of it. This Scrap Driver's excellent.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I just learned by watching Dickson make weapons.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? 'Course, Dunban's weapon still beats them all.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Monado... I hope I can figure out the secret of its power one day.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You will, Shulk. Anyway, we'd better get back to the colony. If I'm late for drills again, old Square-tache is gonna kill me.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Square-tache? Oh, the Defence Force Colonel. He's pretty scary.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Tell me about it...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry, I didn't mean for you to come all the way out here during your break.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't worry about it. Let's get back. Here we are. I'd better stop in at HQ. You off to the Weapon Development Lab?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, when I've sold any parts I can't use.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? All right. See you later.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Uh-oh! The colonel's gonna explode. Same old colonel. At this rate, the men will all be dead before they see any action. Dickson! When did you get back to Colony 9? Your research notes really helped. Well, anyone can activate it. The problem is controlling it. Yes. If anyone other than Dunban were able to control the Monado, we could surpass any military force in the world. It's still only conjecture, but it's starting to look like the Monado might be something far more significant than just a weapon for defeating Mechon. It's the symbol that appears in the centre when it's activated. What I know is, the central piece is made from multilayered glass. The symbol appears on the top layer. And each layer is constructed differently. Which means... If we could just unlock the Monado's power...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban! Dunban!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't look like that. I haven't gone yet. Shulk... It was the Monado. It was...controlling me... Even so... It saved us...saved our future... Next...it will be up to you...\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban... OK then. I'll see you later.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban, are you awake yet?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is it time to eat already? You didn't have to bring it yourself. You could have just called me.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't be silly! Do you want me to feed you?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't treat me like an invalid. I'm better than I was a year ago.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Much better. I really thought I lost you back then...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. But now I'm almost well enough to handle the Monado again.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban, don't say that! The Mechon have gone now! Why would you say that?!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I just mean I'm prepared. Sorry.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. More importantly, eat up before it gets cold. I made something really special today.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't feel like you need to stay here then, Fiora. Go and make your next delivery. Well, I'm sure you'd like Shulk to try some while it's still hot?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's OK. Shulk has no sense of taste. He'll say it's delicious even if it's stone cold.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? In which case today he would actually mean it.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Maybe.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm fine, Fiora. Off you go.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. Dunban... Thanks.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm not finished yet. I have to be prepared to use the Monado again.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson! I just thought I'd take Shulk some food. I'm on my way to the lab. Really? Outlook Park! OK. Thanks, Dickson.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Monado... It's the only sword that's effective against the Mechon armour. They say that before time began, it was wielded by the Bionis. The same Bionis that we all live on. It must have a secret. That's how Dunban was able to destroy so many Mechon. And why he lost the use of his right arm. If I can just unlock the secret of its power...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! This is great! It tastes so good!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Really?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's amazing!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh, Shulk, you say that every day.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not quite. It's always delicious. But today it's amazing.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Really?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thank goodness! I used some special herbs and spices today. So if you said it was just the same as usual, I'd know for sure you had no sense of taste!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh, nothing. The breeze feels so good.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. I'd forgotten what it feels like. I never thought it could be so quiet here.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're spending too much time with Reyn. You're getting used to all the noise he makes.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, maybe.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's so peaceful. You know, Shulk, I hope every day can be like this, always.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The debris siren.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Strange. There hasn't been much falling lately.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There might be more on the way. The Anti-Air Batteries can't protect us out here. Let's get back to the lab.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. Reyn?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn! What are you doing?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk?! No, I'm just...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Goodness.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! Are you OK?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm fine.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's broken.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do you mean it's broken?! Don't you care about me?! I could have died!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're not hurt, are you? The Monado can't cut people. More importantly... What were you thinking, Reyn?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry. I came to ask a favour but you weren't here. And I saw the Monado and-\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I know I'm here a lot. But even I need fresh air sometimes. Is your body still feeling numb? We have to be very careful with the Monado. It's not a toy.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I know, man. I just wanted to touch it. I didn't know it would do that. Sorry. But is it true? The Monado really can't cut people?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The pattern in that circle... Or maybe it's a symbol? I think it shows which power the Monado has at the moment.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You think it's a symbol?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well, if I can find a way to increase the number of symbols, I should...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm sure that's all very clever. But! Why were you more worried about a machine than me, Shulk?!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well, I just... I just explained why.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's not the point!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry! So of course I want to get my revenge! No!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What on Bionis happened there?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn, Fiora...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are you OK? Does it hurt?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. Reyn, when you held the Monado, did you see anything?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You know... Like, a blue blade made of light came out. Same as just now.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't mean that... A feeling like time had stopped. And then...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Time had stopped?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So...was it only me who saw that?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That sounds strange. Is it another Monado thing?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who knows? Anyway, no matter how good a sword it is, if that's what happens when you hold it... Looks like Dunban really is the only one who can use it.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I won't let my brother use it ever again! Not after what it did to him.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh, sorry... I didn't mean it like that...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Anyway, the point is, I'm fine. To be honest, this has happened a few times before. I've been researching the Monado for a long time.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Don't act as if this is nothing!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look, don't worry about it. Anyway, Reyn, what did you want to ask me about?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ah, yeah. Old Square-tache has gone and put me on punishment duty. Fancy tagging along?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Punishment? The colonel was pretty angry today. Did he hit you?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well, whether he hit me is neither here nor there, really... Although actually he did end up hitting me. And that ain't all. He made me do a thousand squats and sit-ups.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Whoa, nasty.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. And now I have to go all the way to the Mag Mell Ruins and back.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So you have to go and collect the Ether Cylinders?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's the one! They're used to power the mobile artillery. It looks like the damage's been repaired. But it can't move without the ether energy. And it seems like the fuelling station's all out of stock.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is the mobile artillery that big machine that crashed in the Residential District?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, probably.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You know your way around there, right?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. OK, I'll go with you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah! Knew you would!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hold on. The Mag Mell Ruins are in Tephra Cave, right? I heard that there's a Mell Lizard nest there. I couldn't take it if anything happened to Shulk. He's delicate - not like you, Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What are you on about?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'll be fine. I can take care of myself.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK, I got it. I'll make you a promise. Shulk won't even get a scratch.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A promise doesn't mean much coming from you!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She don't trust me at all.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nah, she doesn't mean it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You forgot something. You will be needing the transport cases, right?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm coming along as well. I'd feel better going with you boys than sitting at home worrying about you. So, let's get moving!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I knew she didn't trust me.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Looks like it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are these the Mag Mell Ruins?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Haven't you been here before?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nope.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Defence Force often uses it for training. But I come here to do research. It's not really a place that people go.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not surprising. There are monsters around here that use Mechon parts as armour.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Was this built by the Mechon?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't think so. There's a path for people to get in. It might have been a vehicle of some kind.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Like the Defence Force hover transports?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A vehicle? But it's so big...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's amazing technology. I wonder what kind of people made it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I ain't got a clue.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Let's keep moving. The Ether Cylinders are up ahead.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right! Right here! Thanks for the help, Shulk. I'll start collecting them up. You two hold on a sec.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's full of Ether Cylinders... Hey, why do we have to come all the way here to get them? Isn't there an Ether Cylinder fuelling station in the colony?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well. Refining the ether takes a long time down there, and sometimes cylinderisation fails. And there are so many cylinders here for us already. It's more reliable than making them ourselves.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right. And Colony 9's Anti-Air Batteries and mobile artillery are standardised for these cylinders, so they can be used straight away.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I see. You know, this place is in good condition considering it's ancient.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It might be... That there's some form of technology being used to preserve it. It's just a shame we don't understand its secret.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk...?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But I'll solve it one day and show you. If it's just technology that someone created in the past, it's not incomprehensible. We'll come to understand it one day.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't go trying too hard. We can come and get Ether Cylinders whenever we need them. Besides, it's a good place for Defence Force training.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, so good that you didn't even want to come here without Shulk to back you up! Anyway, did you collect the cylinders?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yep. All done. Thanks.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Just come by yourself from now on.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shh, be quiet...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are they Mechon?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't know! But it looks like we'll have to destroy them!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? In that case, just leave them to me!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora, are you OK?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm fine. How about you?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm all right. Thanks to you and Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What on Bionis were those?! I've never seen anything like them.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Could they have been Mechon?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. I think they were something left by the civilisation that built this vehicle.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They didn't seem like Mechon to me. But why did they only show up now?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't know. But they were probably built to protect this place. They might have been activated in response to something... But I don't think that something could have been us.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Please, let's go back. I don't wanna be here anymore.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Me neither. And we've already got the Ether Cylinders.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's going on?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Listen. What is that?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That sound... In the sky! It's a...!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This can't be!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No way!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Mechon!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How? Didn't my brother destroy them all a year ago?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Could that defence mechanism have responded to the Mechon?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Let's get back to the colony!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Come on! They're eating people!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's horrible...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is Dunban OK?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! Go and check on him!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Heads up, Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If this thing wants a fight, let's give it one! See? Didn't stand a chance!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's not that easy! We've disabled it, but only for now. It'll reactivate soon! Where's Dunban?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He's gone! I can't find him anywhere.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What?! He ain't fit enough to face these things!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn! Let's get to the lab!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The lab? Of course! The Monado's there!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Exactly. The Monado can take out Mechon.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The colonel! The guys! The colonel... The guys... I'm gonna destroy every last one of those damn Mechon!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! The entrance!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No! We'll never get in there now...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wait... Let me think here... Reyn, Fiora! There's still the mobile artillery!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right! If we recharge it with those Ether Cylinders we collected, we can blast our way in!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's in the Residential District!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Great!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? All right! This is it! Time to avenge the colonel and the boys! What the?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! More from behind!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn! Looks like you and I will have to cut a path through them.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Looks like it.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! Reyn and I will open up a path. Then you can run through.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You two can't do this by yourselves! I wanna fight as well!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get through! We'll be right behind you!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But Shulk...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A year ago, Dunban and the Defence Force fought hard to protect the colony and all of us Homs. Now it's our turn to repay them!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Please, Fiora.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk... Reyn...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't look so worried. We'll just get rid of these ones. Shulk won't get a scratch!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. I believe you.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Go now, Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Huh?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You take care too!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Of course! Looks like she trusts me after all!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I told you. That was a close one.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You were never cut out for this stuff. You go. I'll take care of things here.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're too out of breath to persuade me.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Tell me about it.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn, behind you!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get outta here, Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't be stupid! Hold on! The Monado!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry I kept you waiting.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Whoa yeah! The Monado! So this is why you weren't at home. I thought so! This is what I was waiting to see!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ready, lads?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nice one, Dunban! You didn't waste any time on them Mechon!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Where's Fiora?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Residential District... We said we'd meet her there.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Looks like we'll have to take the long way round.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? All right, then we cut through the Commercial District!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban! You can't take any more of the Monado!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But I must! I don't have a choice!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn's right. You can't go on like this.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban. This time... It's my turn.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, no! It'll kill you! Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's happening?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What the?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wow. Shulk's pretty awesome!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How can this be? Shulk is using the Monado.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What was that?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! More company!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn! Dunban!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I got your back!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, do you feel all right?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm OK. But there was something strange. Just now, it was as if I could see into the future. Is this another power of the Monado?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? See into the future? What are ya saying?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are you certain? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I see. I remember Dickson saying that the Monado had a hidden power. Could this be it?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't think about it now! Just believe what the Monado showed you and fight!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Got it!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's massive.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That Mechon... It has a face?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That don't mean nothin'!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's right! Not when we have the Monado! The Monado! It's not working!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oi! What d'ya mean?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How can that be? The Monado should cut through Mechon with ease!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is that light? Other Mechon don't have that. Could... Could that light be why the Monado has no effect?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Reyn! Get down! Stay back! I'll take it from here!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No! You can't take any more!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everyone. Get away, right now!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What did I just... Fiora! Get back!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I won't let you hurt any more people! We will save Colony 9!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! Get out of here! Run!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You want more?! How?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! No! I'll kill you! Die!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Get back here!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No! Fiora...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The breeze feels so good.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. I'd forgotten what it feels like. I never thought it could be so quiet here.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're spending too much time with Reyn. You're getting used to all the noise he makes.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, maybe.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's so peaceful. You know, Shulk, I hope every day can be like this, always.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey. Have you been to see Dunban?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I just can't do it. You got more guts than me.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not at all. It was him that consoled me.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I guess that's the type of guy he is.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. Even without the Monado, he's the strongest person I know. Uh...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk. How are you holding up?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm fine. But...you...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I will shed no tears.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Huh?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A year ago, I felt the same sense of deep loss that I do now.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Battle of Sword Valley.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? After that battle, many of my friends did not make it home. While I was being brought here on that stretcher, they were all I thought about. But I decided I would not cry. Everyone who died in that war had something they wanted to protect. Family, friends, loved ones, their home... So they fought to protect them. And we won. No matter how painful, no matter how hard, it's nothing to be sad about... I decided that there and then.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, Fiora would tell you the same thing. She wanted to protect us. Or rather, she wanted to protect you. And you're alive now. So I will not cry.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Remember the gift of life that Fiora gave you, and treasure it.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I...I can't say that I understand. But...I hope to, some day.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That is all I ask. Believe me, I am always just trying to understand.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? 'Treasure the gift of life that Fiora gave you.' He's one of a kind, that Dunban.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I've made a decision.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Huh?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? My purpose in life - I will pursue that faced Mechon.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They attacked our colony, killed Fiora. I will find that Mechon - find it and destroy it. Destroy them all! What are you laughing at?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry, sorry! It's just a bit weird. I never thought you'd be the one to say it!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So you agree?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? 'Course, man. I'm just surprised you came out with it first!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You thought I'd try and talk you out of it! 'That's not what Fiora would want!' That sound right?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. Something like that. I thought you'd give me a hard time.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? In my head, there are two versions of me. One of them is saying that. It's telling me, 'Listen to what Dunban said.'\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What about the other one?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It keeps shouting, 'Make them pay!' 'Destroy every single one of them!' And it won't stop getting louder.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That doesn't sound like you. Sure it ain't my voice in there?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Might be! It's a bit of a loudmouth!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There you go then! So when are we heading off?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right now.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Perfect. Right then.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look after yourselves, boys. As soon as this heals, I'll be right behind you. And then we will seize our destiny. Together.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's all very well going after that metal-faced Mechon. But shouldn't we have some kind of plan?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How about checking out Colony 6?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Colony 6... The only other Homs colony left.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Colony 6 is on the way to Sword Valley, where there's supposed to be a Mechon base. If that's where they came from, maybe the people in Colony 6 saw something.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Good point. They might even know something about that metal-faced Mechon. So we go past the Mag Mell Ruins and up through Tephra Cave. Then we should arrive at the Bionis' knee.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. And if we can get to the knee, it ain't far to Colony 6, right?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sounds like a plan! Let's head to Colony 6. This door... It was closed when we came past before, but it's open now.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Maybe it was programmed to open up in case of Mechon emergency. The way to the Bionis' knee is just ahead. You ready?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, let's go. An ether lamp.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't traders use these things as guideposts?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. We can follow them to the Bionis' knee.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. But if armed traders need guideposts, it must be pretty dangerous in here. Let's keep our wits about us.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Definitely. What the...?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look at the emblem. They're traders from Colony 6. No wonder it's been so long since the last delivery.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn, their injuries...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They weren't made by no Mechon. It was probably the monsters that live here. Man, that's grim. I don't wanna go like this. Not even killed by Mechon, just some monsters in a cave.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They probably had families...children...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Maybe. It wouldn't surprise me. But why do you say that?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No reason. Reyn, shouldn't we return them to the Bionis?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh, right. What's born from the Bionis is returned to the Bionis. That's the way of the Homs. That was way harder than I thought it'd be. I'm just about ready to collapse!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Let's take a rest. If the monsters in here killed all these traders, we need to be at our best. I'm wide awake, so I'll take first watch.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thanks, man. The nap'll do me good. Shulk. My turn.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Awake already?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Didn't sleep a wink. And I still feel like I just did one of Vangarre's drills!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Heh.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey... Why do you think the Mechon attacked? Are we just food to them? Or, what, did we do something wrong? Sort of reminds me of the battle between the Bionis and the Mechonis. I wonder if it's anything to do with that?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well... It's hard to believe that living things are just a source of energy for machines. There has to be another reason.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Mechon killed Fiora.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You know what? I'll never forgive 'em. I don't care what their reason is.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hmm. When it happened, the Monado showed me that Fiora was in danger. But I couldn't save her.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's not your fault. Just 'cos the Monado showed you some future, that don't mean you could do anything about it. You did great. You fought them off. I couldn't have done that. You know, I've been thinking about it. Why you can use the Monado, I mean. Dickson told me. You're a survivor from the Monado expedition team that went out 14 years ago. There was a blizzard or something and your mum and dad died. And then Dickson found you and brought you back.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That sounds right. I was pretty young, so I don't really remember anything.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is that why you do it? Why you're always helping Dickson with his research and trying to figure out the Monado?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Maybe. Part of me does see it as something to remind me of my mum and dad. But mainly, if it really is the sword that the Bionis used to kill the Mechonis, like in the legend... I want to work out its secret. That's the real reason.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I've got it! You were chosen. By the Monado.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What? Chosen?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't you see? Not even Dunban can handle it. It ain't chance that you can and he can't. I'll take the next watch. You get some rest.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK, I'll try. Night, Reyn. I... The True Monado?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What're ya playing at?! Give us a hand!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm sorry, Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't worry about it. It looked like you were having a nightmare!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Really? The True Monado? Was I dreaming?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's with you? We'd better get a move on.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It wasn't a dream. Was it a vision? What should I do? I could tell Reyn. But... I don't know...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What on Bionis are those?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Monsters' egg sacs...I think... But it looks like there are Mechon parts inside as well.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Man... What kind of monsters are they?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Probably some type of Arachno... Reyn! Get back!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Argh! Urgh! Ahh!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn! No! If that vision comes true, then Reyn...! I've gotta find him!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You things just don't give up, do ya?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn! I've gotta hurry. If I can get up there, I should be able to reach him.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Where are ya?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn! Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's too many of 'em! I kill one, and ten more pop up!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn! No! Not that way! Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's this?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The power of the Monado?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look out!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Glad one of us figured out these things would try an ambush. Let's do this, Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Looks like the Monado works on more than just Mechon. I gotta say, that's pretty awesome!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn... I just realised something.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Huh?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The future I see... It isn't set. I think it's more like a warning.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A warning?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah... A warning about what will happen. What will happen if I don't do anything, or if I can't do anything. So I can use this power to change the future. And that's exactly what I intend to do.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You've got my vote. And if you really can do that... I think Fiora would have liked it too.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right, let's get moving. We're nearly at the Bionis' knee.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wow!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No matter how many times I see this, I never get used to it.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? On the other side of those clouds...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yep. It's our enemy. Mechonis.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Our enemy...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If we just came up the Bionis' shin...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then this must be its kneecap, right?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yup. Which means Colony 6 is up ahead!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Looks like we can climb up there.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Great! I love a good climb. Shulk! Look over there.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Smoke...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Maybe someone's got a fire going. Hope they're cooking up something good!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's hardly a good spot for a barbecue! Come on, let's take a look.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Someone's left a buggy out here.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's strange. Who would just abandon a buggy in this place? And it's pretty new.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is it brand new?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not brand new. But it's in very good condition. You wouldn't just abandon it. So what did happen to the driver? There's a boy! He's being attacked by monsters!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You saw it happening? Where?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't know! But it was near some water.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Near water... But what made you have a vision all of a sudden?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Maybe it was triggered by touching the buggy.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well, we'd better find him. Let's search everywhere round here where there's water!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Over there! You all right, kid? That can wait. Go! Get outta here! Leave these guys to us.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Let's do this!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ready when you are!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. It should work now. I fixed the circuit, but it's out of ether. Change the cylinder and it'll be as good as new.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I think it's time for the introductions. I'm Reyn. He's Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Pleased to meet you. Your camp?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How about it?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Let's take him up on the offer. I'm surprised there's a Homs camp here, but they might have some information.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I suppose.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Juju, can you tell us how to get there?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then what? Got it. Now, let's make a move.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That gear. You must be survivors from the Defence Force! Is Colony 6 OK? Did Gadolt make it?!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hold on. What're you talking about?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We've come from Colony 9.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Colony 9? Oh, so you're not from Colony 6. Thank you for helping Juju. I'm his sister, Sharla. Did you now? Well, all right. I suppose that's only fair.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Did something happen? To Colony 6?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Actually, we're heading there ourselves.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Colony 6 has been... Our home! It's been occupied by the Mechon. I'll tell you about it inside. Follow me. We had already fought off the Mechon a year ago, at the Battle of Sword Valley. It left us with a false sense of security. The Colony 6 Defence Force didn't even notice the approaching Mechon. By the time the air-raid siren sounded, a swarm of Mechon had blackened the sky. They ate people and burned our buildings. Me and Juju dedicated ourselves to evacuating the children and elderly. I don't know what happened next.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's just like what happened to Colony 9.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They attacked your colony as well?!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. It's good that you managed to evacuate so many.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We have Otharon...the Colonel... to thank for that. Him and Gadolt.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This Gadolt...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He would have been my husband by now if not for all this. Cheer up, you two!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Er...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We can't lose hope just yet! I'm certain Gadolt and the other soldiers are alive. They're still fighting. I can feel it.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hmm?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You bet! We're up for some revenge. I bet we can even get your colony back!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There you go showing off again...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Juju! The people here need us! How many times do I have to tell you? Even if that's true... No, especially if it's true! We cannot expose the camp to any more danger.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Kid! You oughta know how Sharla feels. Watch your mouth and have some respect! Maybe I was too hard on him. Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn, you really remind me of Gadolt when you get angry.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I do?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt's taken care of us ever since we were young. I always saw him as a big brother really, but he was more of a father to Juju... He'd call him 'kid' whenever he told him off, just like you did.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't think I'm ready to be someone's old man just yet... Shulk? Did it happen again?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You had another vision?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh no!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No! Juju! The buggy's gone! He's going to Colony 6 on his own!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Stupid kid!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We have to hurry. Something bad's gonna happen.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What did you see?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A deep valley... Everything's engulfed in flames... There's a black shadow... It kills Juju.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is it the Mechon with the metal face?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Where does it happen? Is it near Colony 6?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm not sure. I think so.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Let's get after him, Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hold on a second! What was all that about?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I know you won't believe this... but Shulk can see the future.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The future? That's not possible.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's what I thought too. I still can't explain this. But that vision will come true unless we stop it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So you're telling me Juju's in danger?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Believe it or don't believe it, that's your call. But I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for Shulk's visions.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Juju... OK. I can't say I believe you. But what have I got to lose?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I like the way you think!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sharla, you're...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No, nothing.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What are you doing? Let's go and find Juju!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? When you talk like that you sound just like Gadolt! That's how I know it's not worth arguing.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What am I, some kind of Gadolt substitute?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That thing kills Sharla too. I saw it in the vision. But I can't stop her coming with us. I don't know how I can protect her. But I have to do it. I WILL change the future.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sharla, do you know which way Juju went?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There are quite a few ways to get there from here, but he's in a buggy, so I think he'll take Raguel Bridge.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Raguel Bridge?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's not far. It's a really old bridge. Built around the time Colony 9 was founded.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. Let's make that our next stop.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sounds like a plan! Sharla, you stay back. Leave any monsters up to me and Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What, you think I can't pull my weight in battle? I've got field experience as a medic. If you get hurt, I can use ether to patch you up.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nice! I'm always getting roughed up. You'll be a big help! Hey, Sharla! Look!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's Juju's buggy!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Juju!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is it?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's Juju!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Is he OK?! Tell me!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's a Mechon... It's taken Juju!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? When?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm not sure. But I don't think we've got much time.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You said you saw a deep valley, didn't you?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's a place like that just up ahead. And it's even on the way to Colony 6. That must be the route Juju's taking.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You sure? No other deep valleys round here?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not as far as I know.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well, Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Let's move. That has to be where Juju is.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is this the place you were on about?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This is it all right. At the end of the road there's a path to Colony 6.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But there's no sign of Juju. If my vision was right, he should be around here somewhere.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm sure he would have gone along this road. I just hope nothing's happened to him yet.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Any chance he went up that way?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's not safe around here. I doubt Juju would go off the beaten track if he could avoid it.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Got it. We'll search along the road.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Juju! Juju! Hold on, I'm coming!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wait! Sharla!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Juju!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Another new symbol's appeared on the Monado! Can I save her?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk?!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Its tentacles could come out from under the ground at any second. One false move and you're done for. Wait for my order! Reyn, you got my back?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? 'Course! Leave it to me!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Amazing! I didn't know you could do that!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's not me. It's the power of the Monado.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's right. And the light swirling around us... That's the Monado 'n' all. Sharla! Let's move! Is it down?! Get back here!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's up there! Let's go after it!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Juju! Are you all right?! I'm so glad you're OK.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey! Looks like we changed the future! What's up?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well, it's just that... That can't have been the Mechon from my vision.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, weren't it supposed to be that one with the face. I guess we changed more than we expected! Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. Something's not right.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Juju!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No! It's not him at all!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But this one's got a face 'n' all!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What? It spoke! Juju!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Juju!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You pile of junk! Let him go!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn! Better watch your back!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Got it! Cheers, Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why? Why can't I use the Monado?! It's only the ones that have faces. But... I can still see what it's going to do! Just like before!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Leave these to me! Go take him out!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Got it!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Now!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right! It's just bouncing off 'im! Shulk! Look out! You! You're gonna pay!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Juju... Gadolt! Otharon. But... Promise me. Promise that you'll meet us outside the colony. I... Just make sure you get out of here alive! Gadolt. A promise is a promise. And until I see you again, I will protect everyone. Juju! Juju! Where are you?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey there. Are you all right?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The sleeping princess awakes. Had us worried there for a minute.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How long have I been out?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Huh?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How long have I been unconscious?!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Four hours, I'd say.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I've gotta get out of here!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hold up!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Mind if we go with you?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're going to bust into their base, right? We want a piece of them too.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Really...?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Truth be told, we were gonna leave without you. But the thing is...I get roughed up a lot and we don't know anyone else who can use ether.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I... Thank you both. It's been a while... And it's just... I never imagined I would go back to Colony 6 like this. I'm sorry. Lost myself for a minute. We can get to Colony 6 from the valley where Juju was taken. It's this way.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This is Colony 6?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's like a fortress. Did people really live here?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So much has changed... It's only been a month.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We'll find Juju and then smash some metal!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wait! We can't just rush in.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We could enter through the mine.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Mine?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's a massive ether deposit under the colony. The first settlers here built right on top of the mine. That's how we got our colony. The mine is like a network of tunnels. It's much more complicated than the colony streets. They can't have figured it all out in the space of a month.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She means it's the best route if we want to remain unseen.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're catching on.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Great! So how do we get in?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Through the Drainage Outlet. It's just up ahead. Guys! Kill the noise.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A Mechon.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can't believe they've taken the mine too! That means the Defence Force and residents are... Oh no, Juju!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Keep it together, Sharla! Don't start panicking now.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You said yourself, they can't have seized the entire area, right? I bet you they're holed up someplace safe. Juju is alive, and we're gonna find him.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's why we're here. You can count on us.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes, it'll be fine. Reyn... Shulk... Thank you. An Ether Rifle? Gadolt!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sharla, wait!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt! Otharon!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's our cue, Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh yeah!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sir. Isn't Gadolt with you? Sir. Sir, what about Gadolt? Gone?! What do you mean gone?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Some of the people in Colony 9 got eaten...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry. Forget I said that.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are you sure? You can count on me. What?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You say something, Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. It's nothing. Forget it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hurry it up, slowcoach!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's wrong?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What can it mean? 'This is for you.' Is Juju already dead? Or is he going to be killed? Is that why Otharon... But then... What does that mean? If we keep moving, is Otharon really going to die? No!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's wrong Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's not it! I... It's just that... Listen... Maybe we shouldn't just rush in head first.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We got this far.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I think we should observe them and plan our attack afterwards. It's just...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sir! What's got into you?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A vision again? Don't tell me, another death?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I knew it. The Shulk I know doesn't just chicken out for any old reason.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This vision... Was it like before?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Kind of. I saw an underground ether river. And Otharon...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? An ether river. You know what? That sword lets you see the future. All that power and you still keep getting it wrong.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Better to use my brain than my fists.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, I may rush in head first, but at least my head's useful for something.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK, OK. I get the idea.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I ain't done yet! You're useless on your own, Shulk. That's why we're here.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn, I...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Next time you have a vision, you tell us. We bear the burden together, as a team. You have a vision you don't like, we'll change the future together. Got it?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Got it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What was that! Say it like you mean it!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I got it, all right! Next time, I'll tell you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He's right, Shulk. You two saved Juju once before. I know we can do it again. I believe in you.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thanks. They're right. We'll change what happens. Anyway, I didn't see Juju and the others dying. There's still hope.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We're here. The Central Pit.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Where are they all? I don't see anyone.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We'll take that lift.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm ready to mash some Mechon!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah! Juju, Otharon... Just hold on!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No... They're gone. So whose blood is... Oh no!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, isn't that...?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's him all right. He's the one who took Juju!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Juju and the others! Tell me where they are! Juju!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Murderer! Xord? So you have a name? What's he talking about?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt... The others... I swear I won't stop until I've scrapped each and every one of you!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get behind me!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn! Sharla! We are Homs. And we won't just stand here waiting to be eaten! How about this! It's the same as before. The Monado's useless against this guy. No! We'll never get to Juju at this rate. I've got to think of something! Otharon, don't do it! At this rate, even if we save Juju, Otharon's gonna be...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You see a vision you don't like, we'll change the future together. Got it?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Change the future. Yes! That's it! Reyn! You grab Juju!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, what are you doing?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Juju! Wake up!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sharla, leave the rest to us. Hang in there you old fool!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Otharon! Hold on!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What a shot!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We can change our destinies. Otharon... You won't die here. Not today. Get out of there, quick! It's giving way!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He's gonna...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But I... This isn't supposed to happen. Otharon!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That was close! You wanna hurry up? My arm's about ready to drop off. Save the thanks for Shulk and his vision. As soon as I saw an ether river, I knew this had to be the place.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Juju... You're safe now.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What did I tell you? You and me can make anything happen.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, you were right. I didn't really do anything. I couldn't have done it without you guys.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Time to head back to the camp.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We'll need to get Juju some medical attention.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's a freight elevator on the next level. From there, it's an easy route out of the mine. As long as it's working...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We'll know that when we get on it.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You make me laugh.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well, I'm right, ain't I?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're absolutely right. We need to move on and stop worrying about every little thing. Come on, guys.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Good. Works perfectly.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You see! What did I say?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We're all impressed.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, why've we stopped?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't know. But I think we're about to find out.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not him again.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This one doesn't give up!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This is our chance, guys.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Did we get him?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? True power? What do you know about the Monado? The truth? When you became like this? What do you mean?! Xord!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get back! We smashed that bronze idiot. Now the people of Colony 6 can rest in peace.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. Are you OK? Thank the stars you're all right. Just outside Colony 6. Thanks to Shulk and Reyn we destroyed that thing. But not everyone made it.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Forget about it, kid. We settled the score.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes, but there's still no sign of that Mechon with the metal face. He's the one we're really after.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's him! Metal Face!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not just him! A whole bunch! And tons of 'em look like Xord! This one can talk 'n' all!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Talk all you want. Because those words will be your last!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm gonna...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How did you...?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry to have kept you. Looks like we were just in time.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's no end to them. Where are they coming from?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can take the smaller ones. But the rest'll be like fighting Xord over and over!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If only the Monado would work on these things!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Focus, Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look out!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You may be able to block a projectile. But let's see if you can block this!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You OK, Dunban?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What are you? That light... Everyone! Fall back, now!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Now's our chance!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We must be outside the tower.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What or who are you?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You will pay for what you've done! You will know the pain and suffering you caused the Emperor and Fiora! Another one... You're not getting away!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get back here!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, Reyn, let it go!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You've got to be kidding! He's the one who killed Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Know your limits. We'll get another chance.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fine.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That thing saved us. Whatever it was.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wait... Dickson? Dunban? You're the heroes who risked your lives a year ago, in the battle to defend the colonies.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban, Dickson, thanks for helping out back there.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't believe we did anything.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What was that thing?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A Telethia. So that's what it's called.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A mystical beast that protects the Bionis.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So, what's your plan from here? Follow that metal-faced machine, I presume?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What else? He's gonna pay for what he did to Fiora.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well then. There's only one place he'd go. Galahad Fortress in Sword Valley. A year ago, those things were building a huge fortress, right in the valley. Tactically, it's an excellent location to launch attacks from. I feel there's a strong chance they've now finished building it. That would explain why both colonies were attacked recently.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So it's settled. Bash down a fortress and smash some metal brains!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Easy, Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's somewhere else I need to go first.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But what could be more important than... Wait... You saw another one.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I was somewhere very high up. I was fighting at the peak of a huge tower. Fighting Metal Face. I heard a voice, and then the Monado's power was unleashed. His armour instantly gave way. The Monado doesn't work on Metal Face at the moment, but if that vision comes true...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Can you remember anything else from your vision?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I remember a huge horn. That's it! As I fought Metal Face, I could see the Bionis' head.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Prison Island?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The High Entia are real? I thought they were a myth!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The High Entia? I'd dismissed them as folklore as well.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Have you ever met one?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wow! Dickson, man, you're just full of surprises!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Stop your whining. You do it 'cos you enjoy it. And you make a tidy profit. Well then, Shulk, what's it to be?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We'll head there.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There are alternatives. We could abandon the colonies, find a place the Mechon will not discover and live in secret.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I realised something when we were fighting Xord. Wherever we go, they'll follow. We can't run from these things. We must fight on.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I see. Then I am obliged to join you.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You want to come with us?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Scared I'll get hurt?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No way! We know you're stronger than anything! Right, Reyn?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You bet!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I've recovered a great deal since we last met. And that miserly old coot over there made me this. Sharp, light. Perfect for cutting through steel. Show me a Mechon and I'll slice it in two. I might not be in peak condition, but I'm useful.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can't thank you enough.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We're in it together now.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You can count on us, Dunban.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So you keep saying... We're at the bottom, so I guess the only way to go is up.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The lower back... I've never seen anywhere like this!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wow... I've never thought about going inside the Bionis.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You really know all the fun spots, eh, Dickson?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We'll push on. No matter what.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everyone, look. It's a group of Nopon.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What d'ya think they're up to?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They must be here for a reason. Let's go and ask them.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Good idea. This lamp... It has a very strange glow.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Good for them.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The breeze feels so good. It's so peaceful. You know, Shulk, I hope every day can be like this, always.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You will pay for what you've done! You will know the pain and suffering you caused the Emperor and Fiora! Dickson. I owe it all to you. If you hadn't found me that day, I wouldn't be here now, discovering the world. Don't be. I don't remember much at all. But I know that my mum and dad left me it. The Monado was their final gift to me. At least, that's how I used to think of it. That's why I wanna discover its true power and help defeat the Mechon. But so far I've just been creating piles of Mechon scrap. This sword... There must be some way... Sorry, guys. Didn't sleep a wink.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right then. Time to move on. How far now?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I understand. Thank you for everything. No, it's OK.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I want to help Shulk. The Mechon must pay for what they did. And I'm sure Gadolt is still alive somewhere. If he is, I have to find him. Are you sure?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No way, kid! You just need to shape up like me! You'll do us proud, kid.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Good luck, Juju. Dickson, are you leaving too? Yeah, I guess you're really needed at the colony. You can bet on it! We won't let the colony down.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thanks for the heads-up, Dickson. The lift don't work!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Looks like it's been broken for a while. We'll have to find another way up.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Another way? You don't mean climb up there?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We may have to.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Come on, you can't be serious? Why'd someone build a lift that don't work?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No complaining! Let's start looking for a place we can climb up. Reyn...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ready to go, Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. But just hold on a minute.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is it, Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's about the Monado. I'd like to ask your permission to use it a little longer.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why ask me?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Monado was your sword. But...I need it to achieve my goal. So...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't sweat it. You are far more skillful at wielding that thing than I ever was. Keep it. It's yours. Besides, I have a new sword. That old coot had the decency to forge this one for me. I owe it to him to make the most of it!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You've fought your way this far. That is proof enough the Monado has accepted you. Don't take my word for it. Believe in yourself, Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Believe in myself?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Never lying down, never giving up. That's our pride and strength as Homs. And we have to make sure those metal monsters know it.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're right!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Time to move, people. This Prison Island Shulk saw in his vision isn't getting any closer.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is this place?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's giving me the creeps.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? At a guess, I'd say we're inside the Bionis. What is it, Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nothing. It's just that... It feels like the Bionis isn't really dead.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wait a minute, Shulk. If the Bionis starts moving around, things won't look good for us! Let's just keep moving.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No, Aizel. Do you really expect me to leave you, run away and save myself? I will not. I cannot return to the capital with this monster still standing! Aizel! Hogard! Aizel! Hogard! Garan! Damil! Bestow the light of your life unto me!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who turned up the heat?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I've never seen such a dense forest.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Me neither. How much further?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This must be the back of the Bionis. If Shulk's vision is right, we've still got a long way to go.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You mean go on in this heat? I'm sweatier than a Brog's armpit!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We'll have to search for the best route. Sadly, until we find a way, we'll have to put up with Reyn's stench.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sharla!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We must be outside the tower.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Father!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What or who are you?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You will pay for what you've done! You will know the pain and suffering you caused the Emperor and Fiora! A silver-faced Mechon... And who was that girl? These visions show me people and places I've never seen. If only I could find out what they mean. We could use them to our advantage.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look over there! A rope bridge! It looks Homs-made.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not Homs, Nopon. Though a lot of them have settled in our colonies, the Nopon are originally native to Makna Forest.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Do you think they'd know the way to the Bionis' head?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can't say. But walking around in circles isn't going to achieve anything. Our best bet is to look for their village. Over there!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, are you OK? You!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk? What's wrong? Another vision?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Kind of. I'm not sure. But first, she needs help.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're right. Let's look for somewhere safe.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There. I see a clearing under a giant tree. We can easily watch for anything approaching.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. I'll carry her.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She hasn't sustained any serious injuries, but her condition is far from stable.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Do you know what's wrong with her?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Her symptoms suggest ether deficiency. It's well-known that Homs are strongly affected by ether levels in the environment. But I've never seen symptoms like this before. A sudden drop in ether content in the surrounding atmosphere causes a reaction. Symptoms range from fatigue to nausea, but in this girl's case...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What can we do?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We're gonna need Water-type Ether Crystals. I'll load the crystals into a cartridge to shoot from my rifle.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're gonna shoot her?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No, silly. I'll fire them into the air and the dispersed ether will heal her.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's what I thought.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But the problem is the crystals. We can't just use any old crystal, they must be as pure as possible. This area must have a water source nearby. We should search there first.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I spotted a waterfall a little way back. What do you think, Sharla? Would a waterfall produce pure crystals?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can't think of a better place.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then it's decided. I'll search for the crystals.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, you're not going on your own!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'll be OK. I need you to look after the group. We're short on water too, so I'll fill up our flasks.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, good idea. Take care man!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who are you? Hello. Alvis? Um. My name's... How did you know that? I know you from somewhere... What are they? Alvis, get out of the way! I'll deal with this myself! From the left? Then I'll go... How?! Now from above! It can't be! I saw its movements before it struck. How can it...? Telethia? You know about my visions? How could you possibly- No, Alvis! Stop! You don't know how to- A new symbol! That was amazing! What was that light? I... control it. By the light of the Monado, I will stop them. Thank you. Hey, wait a second! More importantly, where on Bionis did you learn to use the Monado? A girl? Alvis. How do you know so much about the Monado? Who are you?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's Reyn! I'm over here!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, we looked all over for you. Thought you'd been eaten by the forest!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry, Reyn. I got attacked by Telethia. If it hadn't been for Alvis I wouldn't have survived.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Alvis? Who's that?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'll introduce you. He's the one that... Alvis? But he was...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's no one here.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm telling you, he was right here. He even taught me how to unlock a new power from the Monado.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Just you and me, Shulk. Ain't no one else around. You probably passed out from dehydration and dreamt this guy up. Come on. Wait 'till the others hear this.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He was here, Reyn! I didn't dream it. I'm not lying!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK, OK. I believe you. And while you were having fun with your imaginary friend, did you find any ether crystals?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. Good quality ones too.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Perfect. Come on. We should hurry them back to Sharla. Hang around here long enough and we'll get whacked by an imaginary beast!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm not lying! Alvis... Who are you?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? An enemy that renders your visions useless. This forest holds many surprises. Not least creatures we've never seen before. And now we know there is another who can use the Monado.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can't wait to meet him.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So you weren't just having a sneaky nap then?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm just saying. You and Dunban are the only ones I know that can wield the Monado. How would this guy know how?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. Locked and loaded. Everyone, stand back.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wow. Unbelievable.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She's coming round. All thanks to our medic.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are you OK?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Where am I?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everything's fine. You're gonna be...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get your hands off me!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, watch it!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Forgive me. I did not mean to...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry if we surprised you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are you the ones who helped me?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well, something like that.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Excuse me. My name is Melia. Forgive my indiscretion. I have not had the pleasure of coming into contact with a male Homs.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Coming into contact?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey Shulk. You're creeping this lady out.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shut up, Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This large one is far worse.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Me?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia, is it? How did you get here, then? What, is there no one with you?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I must apologise, but my situation does not concern you. And I shall not be divulging anything to common passers-by.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Duly noted, your ladyship. But if I were to be so bold, I'm guessing that you didn't come here alone and you weren't just taking an afternoon nap.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And what, may I ask, are you doing here? It is rare to see Homs venture this deep into Makna Forest.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We're travelling to the head of the Bionis. We've got a long journey ahead of us.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The head of the Bionis?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We were just figuring out how to get there when we found you.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I see. Then permit me to return the favour by aiding you in your quest.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Really?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There is only one path to the head of the Bionis. It is the path that leads to Eryth Sea.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So this Eryth Sea is at the head of the Bionis?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If you would be kind enough to escort me out of the forest, I will show you the way.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You'd do that?! Thank you, Melia! I'm Shulk. Pleased to meet you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, ah yes. Likewise.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She's a bit high and mighty, but she's a Homs too, right? Why is she here alone?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ain't got a clue. Ask her yourself. I'm not good with her posh accent.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We shall travel to the Nopon village.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nopon village?! That's where we've been heading. We reckon it's our best chance of making it to the top.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Since inhabiting the region, the Nopon have been a great help. You can travel to Eryth Sea from their village.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's settled. We'll make our way to the Nopon village.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Very well. The Nopon inhabit a giant tree. If we follow this trail, we will be safe. This is the entrance to Frontier Village.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So this big tree is where the Nopon live?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I wish to speak with the village chief. Will you permit us to enter? I shall take you to the village chief. Follow me. Nopon of Frontier Village! Melia Antiqua has returned. I request an audience with your chief. Chief, will you hear my request?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Bird Lady?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They are at one with the Bionis. They sacrificed their lives so that I might escape. But this is not my reason for coming. These Homs need your help. Will you be so kind as to listen to their request? They require safe passage to Eryth Sea. I have unfinished business in this region. Once these Homs are safely on their way, I shall be on mine as well.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That girl...something's troubling her.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We found her half-dead and all alone. But I don't suppose she'll tell us the reason any time soon.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Maybe we can help. I'll go and talk to her. Melia. You're welcome to come with us. Is it true? Were you alone in the forest?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That thing must be stopped by my hand. This is my pledge to those that have died.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wounded by a girl... You don't mean you're going to fight the Telethia?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How do you know of the Telethia?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? When I went to collect the ether crystals, some Telethia attacked me. I managed to destroy them and get away.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You defeated Telethia?! Who are you? The Monado... So that sword can...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? To tell the truth, they were the Telethia's spawn. Someone told me the primary Telethia is healing somewhere in the forest. It was you, wasn't it? You hurt the Telethia. Melia?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Telethia escaped from our homeland, and I am tasked with killing it. It cannot remain free. For the sake of my people, and the Nopon, it must be stopped.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia, we can help you defeat it, if you like.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Out of pity?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why, then?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's just... I...I want...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Speak, Shulk. Or I shall be forced to summon the Nopon chief to interpret for me.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I would like to help.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What could you possibly gain from aiding me?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I saw it. At the top of a black tower, you and I were fighting together. Fighting that faced Mechon. I also saw you fighting a huge Telethia.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It threw me the first time 'n' all.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Forgive me, Shulk, but what are you talking about?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk can see visions of the future.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? See the future?! And you expect me to believe this rubbish?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Believe what you want, lady. Same as I tell all the non-believers.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That'll be me then.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh yeah. In any case, the only reason we got this far was 'cos of Shulk's visions. If Shulk says he saw you in a vision, then you must be important to whatever happens next. And if you're tough enough to fight a faced Mechon, you're all right in my book.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You've got my vote. A lady should not go unaccompanied onto the battlefield.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Excuse me! I am quite capable of dispatching the beast alone! I require no assistance of any kind! Chief Dunga, I...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You do know we're listening? A Nopon hero? Now this I have to see!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't be like that. Let's meet him first.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Watch out!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get off me!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? To you!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right in the... Take this, furball!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? New Hom Hom friends! Meet this year's legendary Heropon, Riki! Riki live to serve!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A Heropon, you say? Not sure where you'll come in handy, but the more the merrier. Shulk, are these Telethia as strong as they sound?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. They're quick as lightning and can read your mind.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A mind-reading giant bird. No problem.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can see their movement through the Monado, but even that's not enough to get the better of them.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And we're going up against the daddy version. No one blink for a second.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Eyes wide open!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And don't forget that Melia is our only chance of making it to Eryth Sea. If anything happens to our guide, it's on our heads. The Telethia is our target, but don't forget about the person standing next to you.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban's right.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I am in your debt. My weaknesses are all too apparent.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No worries, Melia!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki's friends, listen to Riki! Dinobeast is big and scary! Friends get ready, friends help Riki get ready!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You want us to get equipment for you?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki's friend right. Hom Hom clever! Friends meet Riki when ready. Then friends and Riki leave together.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Big attitude for a furry footrest. \\\"Dinobeast is big and scary!\\\" Great. That'll come in handy.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is it just me or did we suddenly become Nopon mercenaries?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ready to go! Come new friends, Riki's adventure begins!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki? You do know where the Telethia is, don't you?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Of course Riki know! Melly! Riki hear you hurt Dinobeast!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I did. But only a little.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? When Dinobeast hurt, Riki know it go to place with ether crystals. Friends and Riki go to place with crystals. Then we find Dinobeast! Chief tell Riki! Chief always right!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So you do know a thing or two about this monster. Guess we'll be searching for some ether crystals then.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki? Why are you the Heropon?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why? Because Chief Dunga choose Riki!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He chose you? So you weren't chosen from birth?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Friend wrong. Chief choose by instinct!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? By instinct?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why friend surprised? Chief have sharp instinct. Chief be village seer!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So that's how you became the Heropon? Can't argue with that.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But he is kind of...compact...for a warrior hero.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki owe lots of monies to village. If Riki defeat Dinobeast, village promise to forget my debts. So Riki like being Heropon! What is this? Riki never see before! This not Riki's Makna! Riki never see before!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? To think it has caused this much damage.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do you mean?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are you telling me the Telethia did this?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Telethia absorb and drain the surrounding area of all its ether.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's it! The Telethia is sucking up all the ether, which is causing the natural environment to change.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, the Telethia can read your mind. Expect it to know what you will do before you do it.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I know. I'll aim for its antenna and stop its ability to read my thoughts. With the Monado at our side, it doesn't stand a chance.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It is much more powerful than its offspring. Do not expect it to fall so easily.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I won't. But we have to trust in the Monado.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk has only met Telethia once, and they were merely the spawn. So why is he so sure of himself? Is it confidence or a trust in something? Yes. It is trust. He trusts in the power of that sword. What did he say it was called? The Monado? I see...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Stick together everyone.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dinobeast! Big as Riki imagined!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Telethia! I take this chance to bring vengeance for my brethren and fulfil my duty! Shulk! I will trap it and cease its movement. Strike when the time is right!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Be still!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh yeah! She's nifty with that staff.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I knew it. She can control ether energy without using catalysts or rifle shells.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I've heard that such people exist. But I never thought she would be one. Shulk, Reyn, Sharla! Protect Melia at all costs!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? On it!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What the?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dinobeast grown back thing!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You've got to be kidding me!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's no good. My ether shots are having no effect.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Its regenerative power is too much!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It is all right, Shulk. Destroying the Telethia is beyond us! We should cut our losses and mourn those who perished.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Never, Melia! The men you lost... I can tell they were dear to you. I know only too well that desire for revenge. And the crushing pain of losing those close to you. I can't stand by and let another person experience what I have. This monster is going down! I'll trap him with the Monado! Then the rest of you, hit the Telethia with everything you have!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thank you.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ready?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Now! Dunban!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Bite on this!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Now, Melia! Finish him!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Brilliant thinking. Even though the Telethia can absorb large amounts of ether energy and regenerate at an incredible rate... Absorbing so much energy caused it to implode.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who would have thought? Brute force wins again. Nothing like an old-fashioned scrap. Dickson would have been proud.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It was the only way I could think of. If there had been another way...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't listen to Dunban. Soon you and that Monado will be unstoppable.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's like at Tephra Cave. It was almost natural, instinctive. The Monado responded to me, and I harnessed a new power.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You'll get your chance, Shulk. We'll turn that faced Mechon into scrap.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I know. That's what keeps me going.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hogard, Garan, Damil, Aizel. Are you there? I did it. It's dead. Did you see? I thank you for your aid in my cause. Justice has been served.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're welcome. Besides, it was mostly you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dinobeast! Heropon Riki ready for round two! Hey! Fight over already? No! Riki not know!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm afraid it's all finished.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We couldn't have done it without you, brave little Heropon!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki brave! Reyn also a little brave. Riki happy happy!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look at him. Barely hit a toe and he gets all the praise.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Let him have his glory. A few days ago the villagers wouldn't give him the time of day. Besides, won't you miss him just a little bit?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Chief Dunga! Riki beat Dinobeast! Does Riki still have debt? Riki never hear this! Chief lying! Chief make up prophecy one minute ago! Riki mad! *groan*\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dada? Riki, what on Bionis is going on?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Friends, meet Riki wifeypon and littlepon.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You have got to be joking!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wife and children?! Riki, how old are you?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki have 40 years! Friends look puzzled.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not puzzled...just surprised!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki will! OK, Oka. Riki happy to join friends!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn happy too! Come on, furball.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Indeed. Thank you, Dunga. My thanks for your gracious help.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Chief Dunga is very fond of Melia.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Same Hom Hom, different world. Not fair if you ask me.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Chief Dunga. Will you kindly grant these Homs passage to Eryth Sea? It is my promise to them. You are too kind. The Chief has spoken. You should depart for Eryth Sea at once. Prepare your things and see me when you are ready.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia. What will you do now?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I would like to repay you for your help. Permit me to act as your guide to Eryth Sea.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Of course! We'd love you to.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But I must warn you. Eryth Sea is vast. Do you know where you wish to go?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's a dark tower at the head of the Bionis. I saw it in a vision. That's where I must go.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A dark tower? Then we need not search at all.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So you've heard of it?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Heard of it? I have seen it. A dark tower at the head of the Bionis. Only one place fits that description.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So you know it?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I believe what you saw was Prison Island.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Prison Island. Dickson said the same thing.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Indeed. Melia, have you ever been there?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I have not set foot upon the island, but I know of it. Prison Island is sealed. No one may enter without imperial sanction.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Imperial sanction? That means we'll be needing someone to grant us entry. I've heard that Eryth Sea is home to an empire ruled by the High Entia. They might be our best chance.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You are knowledgable for a Homs.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sanctions, empires? Anyone help here?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A sanction is permission from someone important. An empire must be a place ruled by an Emperor. In other words, we need an Emperor's permission to enter the island.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This Emperor... Is he important?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Long before we Homs built the colonies... A group of so-called royal-types or imperials ruled our lands. Think of them like the heads of our colony. But with much greater influence and power.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Now I get it. Dunban knows more than a textbook!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are you kidding? That's first year Homs history, Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I might have slept through that class... So when do we get to meet these High Entia folks?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You are so... Forget it.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? First we must travel to the imperial capital.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We'll see how easy it is to see this Emperor.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? My promise was to be your guide. I will not break it.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia, isn't that the...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The shortcut to Eryth Sea, yes.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is it?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Friends, jump in ball! All go to Eryth!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Jump? In that? You're nuts, furball!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You have nothing to fear. This will take us to Eryth Sea.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who would've thought Eryth Sea was right on top of Riki's village. Dive deep enough, you can reach their tree!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Perhaps you should try?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Might do. Haven't decided yet.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is something wrong?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Aren't you curious... About why we're going to Prison Island, I mean?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It is not common for Homs to visit this region. You may have good reason, but forgive me. I do not pry into other people's business.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's definitely bugging her, Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How dare you! You clown!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's OK, Melia. We're not strangers anymore.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well, I... You are right.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So then you'll listen to our story?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. Tell me why you are here.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Basically, it all started when...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I see. I had heard about the Mechon assault on the lower regions, but did not know the situation was so grave. How lucky we are...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, what's that?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is that...?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You are looking at Prison Island.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So that's Prison Island...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. And that is the imperial capital, Alcamoth.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's not just me, right? A floating city is a bit weird?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Built with superior defences in mind.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Incredible. What technology makes this possible?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I do not know. And I have never had the need to.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You don't know? It doesn't freak you out?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You can eat bread without knowing how to bake it. Makes sense to me.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You will need imperial sanction to enter Prison Island.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We will travel to the capital first.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And how do you expect us to get up there? Fly?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There is a transporter up ahead. We can use that.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We've been deep sea diving, now we're gonna fly? This place gives me the creeps. But I guess we don't have a choice. Right, onwards to the capital!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Still...\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is it, Dunban?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's a sight to behold. Those look like anti-Mechon defence systems.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who are these guys?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are those wings on their head?! They must be High Entia!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Lady?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Huh.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thank you, Captain. These Homs and this Nopon are my guests. See them safely to the guest quarters. Give them anything they need.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's going on?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I have no idea.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia, are you...? Melia.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I cannot speak now. But I shall fulfil my promise.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I understand.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I will arrange for an audience with the Emperor. Will you wait?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We won't move an inch. Trust me.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? My thanks.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? 'Lady Melia', he says. Shulk, you thinking the same as me?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Whatever her position is here, Melia won't let us down.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm sure you're right.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Huh?!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? More of these guys?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I must report the Telethia's defeat to His Majesty and request entry to Prison Island. Shulk is depending on me. I must hurry to the Audience Chamber. Melia Antiqua, First Princess, has returned, Your Majesty. Your Majesty. But, Your Majesty, I failed to return with any of the subjects you entrusted to me. My inexperience cost them their lives. Emperor. Your Majesty, concerning such debts, there were others who aided me. Shulk and his companions? Shulk's weapon... Do you mean the Monado? Why?! So you intend to keep them confined? Father! I mean... Your Majesty! I assure you Shulk is of pure heart! I... Brother. Me? And not you? I don't know what to... But the soldiers... I am not fit to rule. I should visit their families and beg for pardon. I know, but it does nothing for the guilt I feel. I will. I am to be crown princess. I understand. You think so too? The seer could free Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Idiot birdbrains! What did we do? A fancy prison is still a prison.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What happened to Melia? I don't see her locked up in here with us.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Exactly! She's in on this!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, any thoughts here?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia won't let us down. She promised to take us to Prison Island. And she's not the kind of person to break a promise.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK, Shulk, you win. I believe you. And if you believe Melia, then no arguments from me.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Alvis?! What are you doing here? Is Melia OK? We didn't mean to cause her any trouble. You don't mean...? Hold on, Alvis. I need to ask you-\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The life of the rich! So where are we going?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Anywhere but here. I'm bored of this stuffy room.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK then.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki find Melly for Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki! Wait!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What guard want?\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If you're after Alvis, he's gone.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What happened?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sounds like they need our help.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk and Riki go help! Riki and friends help people in trouble!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Of course. We're happy to help.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Soldier man not worry! Heropon Riki is here to save the day!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I accept. If I am to lead the High Entia despite my mixed heritage... If I am to succeed the throne, then I accept what must be done. Yes, Your Majesty.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Looks like we got them out of a scrape!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Riki tired. Riki sleep in castle now.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Good idea. Let's head back to the capital.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The sooner the better!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everyone's gathered outside.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How come we didn't get invited?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looks like some kind of ceremony...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So that's the High Entia Emperor.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorean Antiqua.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And there's the lady herself.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's her.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She's a princess?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Took you long enough.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Her silver spoon accent was a clue, but royalty?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't doubt that was Melia, but why the mask?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't know... But she's different from the other High Entia.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How do you mean?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melly not like other Bird People. Melly like Hom Hom friends.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You might be right. But there are things at play here we can't understand.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wait a minute!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You'll give a Homs a heart attack shouting like that.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We've got no time to lose! Melia needs our help!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Again? You had another vision, didn't you?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What did you see?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Out with it already!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Excuse me. We ordered room service an hour ago.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who are these guys? More of them!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia's brother? Kallian! Melia is in danger! She'll be killed at an altar if we don't find her soon! That's why we have to find her! Now!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I thank you for escorting me. I must prove my worth as the next ruler. And I am no less prepared to sacrifice my life than those that have fallen before me.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You can't seriously think that? This is your sister! This is Melia!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Easy, Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But Dunban!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This ritual holds a special significance. It is wrong for us to interfere.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't like it!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But am I right in saying that the rules of this ritual affect only High Entia? And if some strange Homs happened to get involved, it wouldn't cause a problem? Or is there some rule that prohibits Homs from entering the Tomb? Then look at it this way. I don't need to know how big a deal this ritual is to your people. What I do know is that your sister's life is at stake. Cut us a break, and we'll save her. My name is Dunban. I'm sort of the protector of this Mechon-bashing band of Homs. You know a lot about a battle you never showed up to. I was only joking! You had your reasons. I can see that with all these defence systems you don't really need to fight.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? One thing before we enter. Alvis, you can see the future, like me? But you're a Homs... No. My visions appear suddenly, without warning. At first, they're obscure. Then as it gets closer to the event, I start to understand.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not much use as a seer then, are you? A coincidence?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But I've seen you use the Monado!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The ancestral altar lies deep beneath the seals. What trials await me, I wonder? I must not lose focus! Melia Antiqua. I have come to be judged on my legitimacy to the throne by the ancestral spirits.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's so cold.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There are remnants of ancient spirits in here. This is no ordinary chill.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well, what does this do?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Descendant? Are you the progenitor of Antiqua? But he passed away thousands of years ago. I do not understand. But I do not suspect any falsehood in your words. Joy? What do you mean? Wishes? I still do not understand. Is this...? Revered Ancestor... I... Explain yourself. Only imperials are permitted to enter this place. Mother's subject? I...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who puts a great big hole somewhere like that?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What a mess, Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Friend not clever touching button!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm with these guys, Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How was I supposed to know that was gonna happen? What about your visions?! You'd think the two of you could come up with something!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You know it doesn't work like that.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Pair of fortune-telling frauds.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You got us into this mess! And it's not the first time either.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki agree with Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why's it my fault all of a sudden?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This time it is your fault.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Precisely.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. We can't waste another second. Melia needs us.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That is a big ball of something.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It look fun and sparkle!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's not attacking us at least.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's happening?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, look at that!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Another defence mechanism!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? At a guess, we're looking at the Tomb's guard.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We're not getting past without a fight.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everyone, Melia needs us. We can't let this thing stop us!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No problem. Time to break my record. Anyone would think we're not wanted! Are we ever gonna find her?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Somebody mean Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shut it, hairball. It was just a button!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We've got to hurry. There's no time to lose! Melia... Half Homs? Melia!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk?! A Telethia in the Tomb? Keep clear! The Telethia is destroying itself!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Almost bought it.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Alvis. Thank you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why did you come?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Monado gave me a warning. That you were in danger. I'm just glad we made it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, Shulk! Whoever that was, is gone.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So they escaped. Shulk. Everyone. I thank you. You saved me.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki smiley smiley! Melly all safe! All thanks to Heropon!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's not how I remember it, cheese ball.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Mother... Your Majesty. But if it hadn't been for Shulk... Brother... I will!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki and friends help save Melly. Riki very happy!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We're all relieved. But something's still bothering me.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is it?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why was Melia chosen as the crown princess? Shouldn't Kallian have been the one to ascend? And her foe in the Tomb clearly opposed that decision.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You have a point.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Kallian is more than a worthy candidate. What reason could they have for choosing Melia? And why would Kallian go along with this?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's a mystery.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Finally! He's gonna let us into Prison Island.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. Not at all. I too must apologise for meddling in your customs. We should not have interfered. Yes. The Mechon devastated our homes, and we lost many loved ones. It is. I do not want to hide our true intentions. Our very existence is at stake. What is it? Yes, it is told to us as children. The two fought and died, killing many creatures in the process. Their remains became our worlds, bringing forth new life on Bionis. That's how we were made. Alvis told me the same thing. But why is this happening now? We used it because we- You're talking about total extinction. Then you'll help us? Your Majesty, we need imperial sanction to enter Prison Island. Will you permit us entry? I saw it in a vision. We will fight a faced Mechon. They must pay for what they did. Is it connected to the awakening of the Bionis? I understand. This is not our homeland. If you decide not to let us go, I will accept your decision. It's OK. Yes? It would be my honour.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wow! Take a look at that! A High Entia air show!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Bird People fly higher than Nopon birds!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They've got some neat tricks. Shulk, I think that's Melia up there!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? By the authority of our divine ancestors, I, Melia Antiqua, am honoured to accept the responsibility of becoming your next benevolent ruler. Should I be deemed unworthy of this calling, or fail to protect the ancestors or the Bionis, I promise here and now to throw myself on the mercy of you, the people.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Most majestic. That fragile girl in the forest is a distant memory.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But which one is the real Melia?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No, it's not like that. They're one and the same girl. I think.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So they've got a new crown princess. Three cheers for Melia.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right, but we're still no closer to that murdering faced Mechon.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Once we reach Prison Island, we'll get our chance. I've seen us there. It must be true.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, man. Maybe we can still persuade big wings? Melia's crown princess now, I reckon the Emperor might change his mind.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Maybe.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn. The Emperor's request was clear. Give him time. There's more to this island than we know. Things are at play here that reach beyond our understanding.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dundun right! Riki and friends visit Melly now!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey! The adults are talking, pops!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki want to see Melly. Riki think Melly sad too.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She might like the distraction. All those stiff ceremonial duties... You decide, Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki say yes!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You came to see me?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki's friend Melly! Melly look amazing before! Riki so proud!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Really? It all happened so fast.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What a stunning garden! The arrangements... The fountain... When the colony is up and running, can I steal some ideas?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? My late mother adored this place.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Late mother? But I thought your mum was...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Her Highness the First Consort is not my birth mother. Members of the imperial family must take two wives: one Homs, one High Entia. My mother is the Second Consort. I am half Homs, half High Entia.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melly live here?\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes, Riki. Since I was young. I cannot walk outside as you see me now, so this garden gives me much relief.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's wrong with how you look? Who cares if you're half Homs? You'll always be you.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Their way of thinking differs from ours. Different ways, different morals.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So that's why you wear a mask in public.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. Shulk, in less than an hour there will be a banquet in the palace. I would like you all to come.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki so hungry he could even eat smelly Orluga!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There'll be plenty to eat.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Finally some decent grub! I haven't eaten anything since breakfast! What's on the menu? Any High Entia specials?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Do not embarrass me at this dinner!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Expectations lead to disappointment. We are talking about Reyn here.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What? That's the last time I sit next to you then!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I have much to prepare. I will have someone call for you later.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We can't wait.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is there something wrong?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're a funny one.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Emperor! It can't be!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's the Emperor!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Father?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Another vision?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! What did you see?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? On that tower... On Prison Island...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What does the siren mean? *gasp*\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Tell me! What happens to my father?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He... It follows my last vision. We're on Prison Island. Metal Face and your father are...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Prison Island? Why would Father go there? No! I must go to the palace. I must stop him. I will go to the Audience Chamber!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wait, Melia! We're coming too!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Brother! Where is Father? The Imperial Staff, it's... So Father has gone?! Kallian! Why did you let him go alone? Father...!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Alvis... You saw something? If he knows, then why? But that doesn't mean...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, we're going!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Respect? Destiny? We don't need rules to tell us when to save the people we care for! You too, Melia. Don't give up on him. The Emperor, your father, is going to die!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's only one thing to do. Are you with me?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Of course!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We are Homs. Do what you must. But your laws don't concern us. No apologies needed. So, Melia, what's it to be?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We go to Prison Island! Prison Island is just ahead.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Do we need to use the transporter?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We do. But first we must unlock the seals.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Seals?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We'll need to unlock two seals to reach Prison Island. Then a door will appear before us, showing the way.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Got it. Move, everyone! Mechon! And something we've never seen before!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Big fish coming!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Can anyone explain what this thing is?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I believe it's one of the oldest creatures on Bionis. I have only seen them as fossils discovered around the capital. To find that they were trapped on Prison Island...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Was it protecting the island?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That would imply it's sentient. I believe it's responding to something primitive.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Primitive?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It doesn't care who or what we are. Its instinct was to defend against anything. But we'll never really know.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We're losing time here. We still haven't reached the island.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki go to island!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Whoa! Big door! Whatever needed this door was massive.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ah! Dinobeast!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's just a statue. Don't freak us out like that, Riki!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is this a person? I can't make it out.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This may very well be the appearance of my forefathers. The legends tell that they differed greatly to how we look now.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And this is what they looked like?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wait a minute. I've seen this thing somewhere before...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dinobeast! Dinobeast!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You might be right. It reminds me of the Telethia as well.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Did your ancestors build this island?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. The stories tell of this place existing long before my people. No one knows for sure, but we think our forefathers are the ones who sealed it.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I wonder what's hidden inside. Well, we'll know soon enough, I suppose.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There! An engraving by the forefathers. I've seen this engraving around the capital. Many researchers have tried and failed to discover its meaning.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, Shulk. That symbol.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah... It's similar to the Monado's symbols. There must be a connection.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Connection?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The sealed door of Prison Island. It is said that only a true successor to the throne can open it.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then the Emperor must be inside.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I believe so. Forefathers. I, your descendant Melia Antiqua, stand before you. For the sake of our world, release the seal! Just like at the Tomb...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's it doing?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Aren't we going to help?!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Please do not worry. It is necessary.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is it, Shulk? Get a move on. You saw it, right? Us bashing that tin man's head in!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hold on a second.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Here we go. I knew you'd start overthinking.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's not much time, Shulk. We've got to go now.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sharla's right. We'll miss our chance to take that murdering Mechon down. And save Melia's father too!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I... OK.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We must be outside the tower.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are we here?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This is it. This is the place I saw.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Father! Father, who is this?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who are you?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Check that guy out!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is this...? You waited for him? But I thought our forefathers imprisoned you here?!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You made the Monado?! But why are you imprisoned?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're telling us you beat the Mechonis with that tiny thing?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That can't be true! Our forefathers would have had better reason!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shackles? You mean... These shackles... They must be the reason the Monado can't hurt people as well. Does that have something to do with the faced Mechon?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't do it, Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But Melia, why?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Something's not right. The forefathers must have had good reason to seal him!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I need that power. I thought you of all people would understand!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I do...but... It's just...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hold on a minute! He only said he'd release this new power. Sounds like a good idea to me.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia, please understand. I must do what I set out to. The Mechon must pay! I will. Zanza!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's him!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Metal Face!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How did you know we'd be here?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A silver-faced Mechon!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Mechon! You will pay for what you've done! Give us back Fiora! Give her back!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What or who are you?! How do you know me? He moves like... But that's impossible!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Emperor!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Father! No, Father. Father!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Emperor! Emperor. I... failed you. Zanza! You're alive! Give me the power I need! What?! Zanza. Mechon! It's not over. The people of Bionis will never let you triumph!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's changing form!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You will know the pain and suffering you caused the Emperor and Fiora! What?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look at 'im!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Monado has changed!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is that a Homs?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No way!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! You're still alive!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Zanza. You have not changed at all. That is clear. But still, I cannot...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wait!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? My mission is complete. Returning to base.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! It's me - Shulk! Fiora! We were too late again. I saw it. I knew it would happen.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why? Why did this have to happen?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Father... Don't say that! I don't care how improper it is. Let me cry. Why does it have to be me, if all it takes is to be half Homs? But...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Your Majesty.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Father, no!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia, come with me.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk...I...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You'll have plenty of time to think about your empire and your people's hopes. If you need me, I will be at your side. But you are an individual. You are Melia Antiqua. And you can't let them get away with this!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're right. My foremost concern is making them pay.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Friends act strange! Are friends sad? Riki sad too because of empty belly.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki, we already ate. Us Homs don't get upset just because we're hungry.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not hungry? Hom Hom must have small bellies. Riki jealous!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We've got to get our minds off this somehow. Dunban's locked himself away ever since we came back.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is it because of the girl who was operating that Mechon?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia. How are you?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do you mean? If you are talking about Father, I'm fine. I have no choice but to the look to the future.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're stronger than me, Melia.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Do not mock me. More importantly, it is time you tell me who she is.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We've known her all our lives. We thought she was killed in Colony 9.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She didn't even recognise us. She's not the Fiora I remember.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looked a lot like Fiora. But if it was her... Then I can't imagine how Dunban feels.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What did he mean?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora is Dunban's sister.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I didn't know!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is this Fiora...important to Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Important?! She's more than important! She's the reason we're out here!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If that really was Fiora, why didn't she reply to me? Fiora... I'd better talk to Dunban. He'll know something. I've been looking for you. So this is where you were.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk? Apologies. Was everyone worried?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Of course. Me especially. It's just... I've been thinking about Fiora, and I can't help wondering...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wondering what?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You saw how Fiora acted. It was like she didn't even recognise us.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. It's unsettling. But Shulk, don't get me wrong. I'm not sad. Even if she doesn't recognise me, I'm glad to know she's alive.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You see, Fiora was born many years after me. And not long afterwards, we lost our father to a Mechon. It was left to me to protect and raise her. Almost like a father.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I was always jealous that she had you as her brother.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ah yes. You and Fiora used to be inseparable.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I need to tell you something. I always thought, if Fiora were to be with anyone, it should be you.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What? But Reyn hangs out with her just as much as me.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, he does. But Fiora doesn't like him in that way.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh, I see.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He's a nice guy. Reminds me of myself when I was his age, all reckless and hot-headed. Probably why he's not right for her. Listen, Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A lost life can never be returned. But she's alive. It doesn't matter that she's lost her memory.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah... I guess you're right.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora and I have spent our entire lives together. The memory of that can't have disappeared completely. It's up to us. We have to help her remember. Help me, Shulk. Help me get her back!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You know I will.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. Let's go tell the others.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, they're back.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Have you gathered your thoughts?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. Sorry to be a nuisance.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk...you too?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yep. All thanks to Dunban.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm...glad.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You think something happened?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We won't know until we get there.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's fine. Is anything wrong? Your Highness, does this mean...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Brother...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I need time before I make a decision.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I do not believe that to be true. Shulk has other people to consider.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That wasn't like you, Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm sorry.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You know you can talk to me.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's Fiora. That's why you're hesitating.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Knew it! You wouldn't think twice otherwise.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I just don't know.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Find her, Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia...I...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I used to believe my father did not love me. Until the day he died. If you do not grasp the importance of loved ones until after they are gone... That is simply too late.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're right, Melia. I've made up my mind. I'm going to get Fiora back!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You don't have to do this. I'll go and look for her myself. The burden should be mine.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. I want her back as much as you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Leave the ambassador stuff to me, Shulk. I'll probably make a mess of it, but we're a team. You can count on me.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I am afraid that is my duty, Reyn. I am of both High Entia and Homs blood. I am the crown princess, and of mixed heritage. Thus, I am best suited to carry out this task.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That means we won't...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. I will remain here. We must say goodbye.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is that what you really want?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. But promise me when you find her, you'll come back. I'll be here waiting for you.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't know what to say. Thank you. It's probably a good idea if I go and tell Kallian myself.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I am sure he already understands. Besides, it's likely that the ministers are harrassing him at this present moment. We should spare him any further inconvenience.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then this is goodbye.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. Come back as soon as you can. We are in great need of your help.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Got it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ahem...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why are you still here?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Listen. I'll keep an eye on Shulk for you.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Whatever can you mean?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's a risky strategy, letting Shulk go off and just hoping he'll come back to you.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk and I are merely...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, yeah. But remember! The longer he's away, the more chance his feelings for you will fade.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But-\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Once we find this Fiora, I will personally whisk him back here in a heartbeat. Don't give up!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I appreciate it.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Great! Don't worry, Melia - I'm on your side!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Brother? It's not what-\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm sorry, Your Highness. About your offer... We must...humbly decline.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I stay because I must, Brother!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's two Melias?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn wrong! This Melly smell different.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Kallian... Speak.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are you sure? Your Highness, that means a lot to me.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That is one cool prince.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If only someone had his sensitivity...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sensitivity? I'm sensitive...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The jury's out on that one. That's a relief.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thank you, Kallian. I will keep her safe.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Regent, I accept your request. I will return victorious with Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Do you want to come?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then there's no point in wasting time.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We'll join you as soon as we can.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You see. Now we're getting some respect.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We're back to this again, are we?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? See you soon, Kallian.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If Colony 6 were in better shape, we could have taken a pod from there. How are we getting there?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So that's our route.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ready as we'll ever be!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Zanza is not dead. I feel it. Our tragedy unfolds once again. Indeed. I do not doubt that Egil, too, is aware. However, why free the Monado? Zanza must realise it is now a double-edged sword. And what reason could he have for choosing the boy? What is this? I am experiencing feelings for the boy? Vanea. Your swift repairs are appreciated. I wish to see that boy again. To meet with the one who wields the Monado. Is Egil aware of my reawakening? Then there is no need to worry. I shall meet the boy. Besides, the Monado will draw him to me.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I could go for a hot cup of Dickson's homebrew right about now. We're not built for this cold.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki hate cold!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This can't be nice for Riki. He's from Makna.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A little further down is Sword Valley, right? Me?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki see it! Bigger than big tree in village!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ruins? I wonder who built them.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Alvis? This the place you meant? Been away?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Throw hot water on ice!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, nice one genius!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And we can use this rock to melt the ice?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sounds good. Start looking for a geyser, everyone.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The letters are worn and difficult to make out. But it's definitely the language of the High Entia.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They look just like the lettering on Prison Island.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If only we could... ...just walk inside.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This place...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Something up, Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No...it's just... I feel like I know this place.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? D\\u00e9j\\u00e0 vu?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm not sure, but... I thought I had it. I can't seem to recall...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are you all right?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What? Must be tired. Don't worry. Wait, you mean...! So this is where the Monado was kept? My dad took it from here... Have you always been able to see the future? You told me you are from a long line of seers. Did you have the ability from birth? And the ceremony was held right here. I hadn't really thought about it. After I grabbed the Monado, I just saw things. You mean the Monado. My visions, under the same principle, are there to disrupt the future. The future would be changed. Is that how Zanza planned to defeat the Mechonis? But why go to such lengths? What happened all those years ago? I used to only believe in what I could see. My home, my friends, the Monado itself! I knew those things were real. Are you saying I should stop?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can't feel my face or feet. What do you think?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn not tell truth! Reyn's snoring make Riki think of Orluga!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oi! I don't snore!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That Mechon! It is you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, that's Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Young Heir to the Monado. We meet again.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora? Is that my name? Then you... You know this body?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So it's true. You really don't remember us at all. Fiora, listen! If nothing else, you must remember your family! That's Dunban over there!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Family? There is family... Wielder of the Monado. There is...a matter I must speak to you about.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What was that?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Metal Face!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Stay alert!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You killed my father!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get him!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get away from her! You!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're disgusting!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? All right. You can have it. But only if you let her go.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But you're-\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is that...?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Mumkhar! I thought it might be, but... You're to blame for all this? You dare ask that of us? Why did you betray us to Mechonis? Why did you kill our friends at the colony? Why?! You piece of...!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We will not bow to you!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melly hit bad guy in face!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're a traitor, Mumkhar. And you're not getting away. You fought beside me at Sword Valley! Why did you change sides? Why the Mechon?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's happening?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is the Bionis moving?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is that it?! That's the puerile reason you've killed all those innocent people? Ravaged our home! Never. I will strike you down and all that you have become, you wretched fool. The Monado will stop you. And then you will know the shame of all that you have done, traitor!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That light!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What the?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's not like the other Mechon. Leader of Mechonis. So you're the one who controls the Mechon! Why?! Why do you trap Homs in machines? What do you want from us? Why make us fight for you?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get your hands off her! Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Mumkhar!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We're coming. And we won't give up! Fiora, we will find you! Fiora! Fiora.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She's...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get it together! Shulk! We ain't got time to be hanging around here! I dunno what's happened to her, but that was Fiora. No doubt about it. You know what that means?! She ain't dead! We've gotta get her back!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get her back... Right! We've come too far to give up now!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then we'll go to Mechonis! And find Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. We will get Fiora back.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Whoa! What the?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is all that big sword? If is then ouchy ouch!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The sword of the Mechonis.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The entire valley below... The whole thing is its sword!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Something seems unnatural.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do you mean?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look. That flowing light. From the way it glows, it has to be ether. But it looks like it's being drawn in by something.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? By the fortress! It should just be up ahead.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Father once told me that the Mechonis absorbs the ether of the Bionis and uses it for sustenance.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So the Mechonis feeds off ether. Then undoubtedly the ether serves as the Mechon's energy source as well.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looks so big, even from this distance. The fortress must be enormous.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Galahad Fortress - the front line base of the Mechon. The Mechon that attack Bionis must all come from here.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then there's a high probability that he's there. The golden Mechon that took Fiora. We're about to enter the Mechon stronghold. If there's anyone who wants to turn back now...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk. Friend should no split up. No leave friend behind. Riki scared but Riki want go too.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He's right. OK, let's go.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's that?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You arranged this for us?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, it's...!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What are you doing here?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah! I was hoping for some new stuff!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You cheap old man! Yes. They made Mumkhar into one. He was the one who attacked Colony 9. Aren't you surprised?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry? Thanks for coming this far. We'll be fine. We can handle ourselves.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Agreed. We will infiltrate via the ether inlets. If I'm right and the Mechon do feed off ether... Then we're sure to find some form of influx channel. Our objective is to reach one of those channels.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I won't! You take care as well.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Looks like it's just us.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right! We head for the hilt of the sword - Galahad Fortress.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? One year on. Now, at last, we will seize our destiny. Isn't that right, Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, look! Can we get in through there?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looks as though it's unguarded. It should make for a decent entry point.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Now's our chance, Dunban.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. But don't lower your guard. The Mechon may just be hiding. Mumkhar! How could you? How could you do this to your own kind?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oi, beardy! You're talkin' pretty tough there! Don't be so sure you can take us all on by yourself!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's that sound?!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You scumbag!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's just like with Zanza! Sharla! Look out!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everyone! Watch out for the green claws! And the other ones' spears! There's something different about them!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How can that be?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You monsters!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Mumkhar! You're gonna pay! Yes. This is the power of the Monado! You wanted it, so now you can have it, Mumkhar! Die!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Stop!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get out of my way! Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's Mumkhar... He's not a Mechon!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Have you forgotten everything he's done? Where is your killer instinct?! Now is the time!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I hate him, Dunban. For what he did to Fiora. And the Emperor. So of course I want to get my revenge!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But... Face Mechon are not like the others. They're people! Like us! Are you really willing to kill another Homs?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. Sometimes needs must!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Even if it's Fiora? What then? When we set out, I wanted to destroy all Mechon. That was my aim. But now... I know that there are people inside. I have to know why. What's the reason for all of this? Why do Bionis and Mechonis have to keep on fighting? I have to find out why!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So, that is your fight?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I will never forgive what he's done. And yet... Your words. They ring true. I feel their weight. We have to help Fiora now. We'll worry about the rest later.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Did you hear that, Mumkhar? We haven't got time to be playing around with you.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Stay back!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Mumkhar! Mumkhar... You went too far, you fool.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? At least he's out of the way. Now we just need to get inside.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They're in there. Fiora and the golden Mechon. Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! What's up?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Did you see something?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You did see something.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? All right. It was the silver Mechon... Fiora. She's definitely inside the fortress.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? All right. At least we know what to expect.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So Fiora is inside. I can't let that vision come true. I have to save her!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Here's our way in.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's no turning back.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We can't let them find us. Let's move!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora's in here somewhere.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Let's get looking. Keep your eyes peeled. I'm ready for anything. I'll trash any Mechon that tries to mess with us! Where are we?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Looks like the control room for an ether blast furnace. There, look at that.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So this is what supplies the Mechon with ether energy.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! What's that?! Looks like fun! Riki want to ride!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We didn't come here to mess about, furball! Time to bounce on!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hold on! If we can stop that piston, we might be able to shut down the blast furnace.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nice idea. Cut off the Mechon's ether supply.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki say we try!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, but how are we supposed to stop something that massive?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If we can stop the turbines driving the piston, it should work. And the turbines should be nearby.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right. Let's search for them.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nice one! We did it!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This should prevent them from mobilising any large Mechon squads for now. Hopefully we've improved the allied force's chances.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hold steady, my brother.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Friends! Here here!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looks like the door's been unlocked.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nice. Let's get down to the blast furnace.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If we're lucky, Fiora might be down there.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, is that?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Spear ones! Loads and loads of spear Mechon!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Stop! Don't you recognise Shulk?! Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora. Please. Don't you remember us at all?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's no use. Everyone, it's time to retreat.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Got it!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Understood.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Move! Shulk! You all right?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, I think so. What do we do now, Shulk? We ain't gonna last long here!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! Try and remember! It's us! What is...?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oi, what's going on?! What's happened to the Monado?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look out!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm OK.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Wait here!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! Stop this right now. How could you? Shulk came here to save you! Do you hear me? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You must run.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! Fiora... Or whoever you are.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Please, run! The machine is not under my control.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not under your control? Is it him?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Egil...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! What have you done to her?! Why make Homs into Mechon?! Why are you making them attack Bionis? Never! Who would ever submit to you?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Forget about him. We have to get out of here.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But... But what about Fiora?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If we die here today, she will be... She will be lost forever.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You chunk of scrap! So it was you who did that to the Monado!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But how can you... Never! If the Monado really is powerless, then why would you want it for yourself? I'll never give it to you! Never!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Egil! I cannot allow this. That boy is at risk. Shulk! Don't let him die! Help Shulk! Help them! Who are you?! Whoever you are... Please lend me your strength! I won't let you do this!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora?! Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Egil... No matter how much you yearn for revenge, I will not permit you to have your way!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No, stop!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Please... Survive!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not good! Let's get out of here!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Where are you?! Shulk, get back here!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora... Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! No!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's been a long time since I last had this dream. I reached out for the piece of scrap metal. And then I fell into the ground. Was I... Was I dreaming? Fiora! What's that? Fiora! Fiora! She's still breathing! Wake up. Come on! Wake up! She needs water. Fiora. You're awake. Do you remember? My name is Shu-\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can't believe it. My first kiss.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You do remember me! Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Of course I do. Shulk. I... I never forgot you, or the others.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then, why?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Because I wasn't me anymore. I wanted to call out, but I couldn't.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do you mean?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? When it happened, when Colony 9 was attacked by the Mechon... I thought I had died. I felt the Mechon's claw rip through me. I couldn't remember anything. There was no sound, no light, no pain. When I came round, I had the body of a machine. And it felt like there was someone inside me.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Someone else? The one who was controlling the Mechon you were in?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes, that voice. But I could still see and hear. I was there all the time. Except I had no control over my body, and I couldn't talk.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And that's why it seemed like you didn't recognise us.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. Inside my heart, I was crying out desperately. But you didn't hear me. Nobody did.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We always believed it was you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's OK. You don't have to say that. I know it would have confused me.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But the person inside you... Do you know who it was?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. I heard her voice when she spoke, but I didn't know what she was thinking. There was something she urgently needed to do. I understood that much.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do you think happened to her?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Maybe she's sleeping. Or maybe she's trapped like I was.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I hope she stays trapped. Hijacking your body, treating it like it's her own.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I guess.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I say good riddance, and let that be the end of it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk? I don't think she's totally to blame.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why not?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She needed my body for something. I don't know what it was. I just know it was important. I want to help.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why would you?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I knew she was using my body, but I didn't hate her for it. She was kind. She was taking care of my body. I could feel it.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Really?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. And she did everything she could to protect you.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So back when we were fighting...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Against Egil. She knew what I wanted to do and did it for me. So I want to help her if I can. Please, Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? All right. Then we'll do everything we can to find out what she was trying to do.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thank you.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Welcome back, Fiora.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm glad to be here. What do we do now?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We have to find the others. I know they're alive. I can feel it. Everyone's gonna be surprised when they see you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everyone being...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn, Dunban, and there are a few others we met along the way. Sharla, Riki and Melia. I just know you're gonna like them.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looks like you've been through a lot as well.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, but nothing's gonna separate us now. Come on, let's start searching.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! What's wrong?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry. My body feels a bit strange. I think I just need to rest. I'm sorry.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's OK. We can take a break here. I wonder what happened. After the fortress. Where did the others all end up? The Monado's light is fluctuating. That Mechon really messed it up. But still. I have to protect Fiora.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk? Can't you sleep?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry. Did I wake you?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. It's OK. I slept really well.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You want to eat? You must be hungry.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No thanks. But I'd like some water.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. You should eat. Even if you're not hungry. You need to get your strength back.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No, I'm fine. This body has its uses. I never need to eat. I never get hungry. I just run on water. Don't worry. I prefer my old body, but this one has some advantages. Shulk. You can leave me. It's OK.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I mean, look at me, Shulk. This body is a Mechon body. So I should live here on Mechonis. This is where I belong.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You don't have to do that.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Fiora you knew is dead. Just think of it like that. It's for the best.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But I can see it's not true! I mean... You're right here! I'll never forget how I felt when I thought I'd lost you back at the colony. I should have done something! I thought, if only I had the power to save you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. No more regrets. I will protect you. Besides, there's someone else inside your head. We can't leave her there.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I guess not.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Mechon! No! Not now!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Let me...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! Right. Come on, Monado. Don't let me down. No! I won't let you take her from me! This time, I will protect Fiora! Yes! The Monado's light! I can do this! The Monado... It worked, but... I feel worse than before. Whatever he did to the Monado is... What's that sound? No! We're surrounded!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Where are we?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're up then?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sharla! What happened to us?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't know. I've only just come round.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Where are the others?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I looked for them, but they're nowhere to be seen.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn, thanks.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Huh?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? For protecting me, back there.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, it got rough but at least you got out safe.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is it?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look at me, I'm useless. Can't even keep a promise. I promised Fiora I'd look after Shulk. Stupid...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You promised to protect the guy who protects you? Am I missing something?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? In the old days, Shulk was kinda frail. You know, like a little Bunniv that gets bossed around by the other colony animals. It was me who used to be there, to save him. That's why I promised Fiora. But now look at me.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He's stronger now. And not just 'cos he's got the Monado. I've done all I can to help him. He doesn't need me.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's not the Reyn I know. Do you remember Colony 6?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Mechon were always on the doorstep of our home, the colony. Thinking about it, I realise they were after the ether underneath it.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. I suppose so. If they could stockpile energy from there, they could get to any part of Bionis.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Colony 6 defence force suffered its fair share of pain. And not just physical. Friends and family...alive one day... gone the next. It all became so normal. You end up wondering how you can possibly make a difference when war is so futile. I'm not the only one who felt like that sometimes. But nobody ever gave up. And you know why?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Because you were strong?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We had no choice but to be strong. Everybody had someone to protect. The moment you looked away, you'd lose everyone you loved. So we had to keep looking straight ahead. We couldn't stop fighting.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Man, that's tough. Puts my problems into perspective. I suppose I should get back to being Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't go doubting yourself, even if things get tough.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're right. There'll be plenty of time to stare at my feet when I'm old and crooked. Get it?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I get it. So now what?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We go looking for Shulk and Fiora! I might be like a third wheel, but I can still lug around the heavy stuff.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Finally! That's the Reyn I know.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Back there, were you talking about that guy Gadolt?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not just about him. Why do you ask?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nothing. Just... You know... Seems like tough competition for a guy like me.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn. Do you think Shulk and the others are OK?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? 'Course they are. They wouldn't die from something like that.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Back to your old self I see! Right, we'd better get looking. What's that sound?!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Someone's in a fight! Up ahead! Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I got your back. We'll turn them into scrap!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Good to see ya. I knew you'd make it, Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thanks to you!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn! Reyn, it's you!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! She remembers us!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. She's been through a lot.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can see.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If only we could find Dunban.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, he'll be blubbering at the sight of us.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hahaha! I don't think he'd ever cry in front of you two.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So he does cry?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? When no one's watching?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yep. He's always been like that. He's a big softy, but he hates anyone seeing it.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I never knew.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nope! I don't believe it!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Take it easy.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm OK. I want to see my brother. Let's go, Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If you can't walk, I'll carry you.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm much heavier now.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I've been pumping my guns.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can see! Reyn, you really looked after Shulk for me.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I wanted to, but it feels more like he's the one who's been protecting me.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's not true!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's OK. I know it, you know it. I'm not here to protect you anymore.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But you are here for something.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. What I did just now. It don't matter how strong you get, you ain't got eyes in the back of your head. So I've got your back!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn, you...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn, you're like a whole new person.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do you mean by that?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I mean, it's good you've become so dependable.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Was I that un-dependable before?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Take it as a compliment!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You haven't changed a bit. What would we do without you?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right, let's go. You wanna see my brother cry, don't you?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, wouldn't miss it!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is it?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can hear something.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What? I can't hear anything.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Maybe our sense of hearing isn't strong enough.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Low sounds. More than one. Watch out! Something's here!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Friends stop for Riki! Riki very hungry! And Riki sleepy! If Riki not rest now, Riki not keep going!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We can't have that, can we? We'll rest here before going any further. Melia, do you need to rest?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I am fine.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Good! Break time!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's this?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Heropon Riki have big fight with fish. Riki win. Grilled fish taste yum yum! Dundun eat too.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I thought you said you couldn't move if you didn't rest.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki very tired. But Riki very hungry too.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How considerate of you.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki not understand Dundun!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't try to hide it. You realised Melia was lagging behind. She would never admit how tired she was. That's the real reason you asked. Now that's good fish. Even in this strange place, at least the fish tastes like it should.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki glad Dundun like yum yum fish!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, thank you.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melly is tired, but Riki tired too. And Dundun not look happy.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's this? Am I that transparent?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki want to hear Dundun's story. Riki listen carefully. For Riki is the Heropon.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm not sure what that's got to do with it. Well, seeing as you're here. I'll tell you.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yay! Riki listen.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I have a sister. Her name is Fiora.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki know. She wears silver armour. Shulk look everywhere for her.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Indeed. Shulk and Fiora... Everyone knows they like each other, but they're just not ready I suppose. They are the perfect match, but if they don't hurry up and tell each other...\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Even Riki know that!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I suppose everyone does. But now Fiora has become something else.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She forget Shulk. She forget Dundun too.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She did. But, Shulk won't give up that easily. Knowing that he's out there looking for her fills me with hope. I just wish I was there with him...\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dundun take care of them!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hmm?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dundun watch over Shulk. Dundun watch over Fiora. That is all a daddypon can do. Riki make mistake. Dundun not daddypon.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well, I am her older brother.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But just like daddypon, watching over family. Same watch over. Dundun do what he must.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who would have thought it? I never imagined I would be getting such advice from you.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki have big family of littlepon. Riki raised and say goodbye to many littlepon. Riki know some things.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You can say that again. I had you all wrong.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It doesn't look like the others are here.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Unfortunate. I hope everyone is safe.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everyone safe. Everyone strong!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki is right. It is simply a matter of when we will happen across them.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everyone landed in the same area. They have to be around here somewhere.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Friends look here! Riki find it yesterday when Riki go scouting.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I wonder where this pipe leads.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Go go! Riki has feeling Shulk and friends are on other side!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Feeling? Well, I'm willing to give your Nopon instinct a try.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? As am I. The pipe it is.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A village in a place like this!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Guys!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're all right!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. And... We found Fiora.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! Do you remember me?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry if I made you worry.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's all right. I'm just so glad you're alive.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dear brother.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, is that your childhood friend?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Congratulations. I'm glad she is safe.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thank you. I couldn't have done it without you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But how did you all get here? And what is this place anyway?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? These people helped us. This is their home. Machina... You mean, machine people?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So, are you Mechon?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A form of mechanical life born of the Mechonis... Is that correct?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Life born of the Mechonis... So there is life here, just like on Bionis?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Explain to us why you invaded our world. What did we ever do to you?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban, please hear her out.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But...\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? These Machina... They're good people.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora? Ever since she was given this body, she hasn't been feeling too good. But we honestly don't know what to do.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm OK, really.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? For us?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, I'm...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on her.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thanks.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hah! He's massive...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We were told that you were waiting for us.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Request?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It is.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. Although unfortunately we were unable to stop Egil. Do you know him? He claims to be the leader of Mechonis. Your son? You want us to kill your son? That is no small request.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who was Lady Meyneth?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You talk like you saw all this. Ain't this all just an ancient myth? You can't be serious?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The people of Mechonis must have a longer lifespan. Just like we High Entia live far longer than Homs.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I get that, but he can't have lived that long.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But why do you want your son dead? From what you've told us, I would've thought you'd want us to destroy the Bionis rather than kill your own son.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So he wants to do to us what the Bionis did to the Machina?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Didn't you ever try to stop him?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Where is Egil now? I feel sorry for him.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What're you talkin' about?! Did you forget what he did to us?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I haven't forgotten, or forgiven! But Egil's clearly suffered a lot in his life. You don't feel any sympathy at all?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? All I know is, this stinks. Who cares what he's been through?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I understand about Egil. But why us? You should be aware that Shulk's sword, the Monado, has the power to destroy Mechonis weaponry. It's said that it was once the sword of the Bionis. Doesn't the very sight of it make you quiver?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do you mean? Is she sick? That's right. How? But you can treat her, can't you? Please!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's OK. I don't want to be a burden to Shulk. I don't care if I have a machine body. Just make it so I can fight beside him.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A problem? But where? We'll take a look. The beach at the base of Digit 5, right? I think we found it. Is this the Piezoelectric Unit? Linada, will Fiora be OK now? But! You're right. I'll try and get some rest. Thank you for everything you're doing. Yes? I'll go and see him. He wants Egil stopped, and so do we. But I need to sleep on it. Thank you. Umm... Yes, very well. I wanted to...talk about your son. Yes. We agree with you. Egil must be stopped. But we can't act now. Before we came here, we heard of plans to form an allied force on Bionis. Any day now they're going to launch an attack on Mechonis. But it's too dangerous. Egil has made a weapon that could kill us all.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The weapon that Mumkhar was using? The one that shoots green fluid?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He said it can decompose any being from Bionis.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We have to go back and warn them. Before it's too late. Dickson?! What are you doing here? I can't believe you found us.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You know each other? Why did you keep that to yourself? That information is vital to all who fight Mechonis.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So they escaped to live in peace? Somewhere they wouldn't be seen. Makes sense.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So this is where you obtained all that stuff you brought back to Colony 9. I wondered where you were getting it from.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I haven't discovered why, but it disintegrates anything it touches. But only if it's living tissue from Bionis.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK! Let me think about it for a bit. Fiora. Dickson, listen. Yes. What are you fighting for, Dickson? Because he's trying to exterminate the Homs? Really? Will they launch an attack on Mechonis? Prince Kallian said that? Yeah. I think that's the type of man he is. We're going to the Mechonis capital. I don't know. I can't forgive the Mechon for what they've done. But after listening to Miqol, I think there might be another way. Do you really think that?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We won't let Shulk die. Not ever!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! Are you OK to be walking around?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yep!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I have to hand it to her. That Linada's pretty good. And not just with machines. She's also quite familiar with organic physiology.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You went to get the thing she needed to cure me, right? I'm sorry I've caused all this hassle. But I'm fine now. I'll be by your side, fighting to protect you. No matter where we go, no matter how difficult it gets, Shulk will do the right thing. It doesn't matter how slim our chances, Shulk will always stick to the right path.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And don't forget, it's because of Shulk that we're all here, fighting together. I think that shows he has a strong character. Am I wrong, Dickson?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson, we're going to the Mechonis capital. About the allied force... Yes. Thank you for all your help.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Vanea...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is she a Machina as well?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hold on. You mean she's Egil's sister?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And you say she'll help us? I dunno why she'd help us, but... We'll try and find her when we get there.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I will. Thank you. Is that possible?! Thank you, Linada!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't make that face! OK, let's go!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is it? We're in your debt. Linada. We will.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Linada, thank you for everything.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Bionis and Mechonis.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's so different seeing them from this kind of perspective.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We cannot see it from here, but our people are still fighting up there.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's difficult to believe that two such huge things ever fought each other. I wonder how the Machina felt at the time.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Must've been horrible.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Scary too.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fear robs us of reason. Out of fear we commit terrible atrocities and call them acts of self-preservation.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fear gives rise to more fear. A never-ending circle of hatred.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Perhaps that circle can be broken?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fear. It must be what's driving this. What's made Egil act this way.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We're inside the Mechonis.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Just how I imagined it. It's all totally mechanical. It ain't gonna be easy getting up this thing.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Egil is at the top...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's up, Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look. It's a switch to activate a lift. If we can get it to work, it should take us up.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki want to ride lift!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We can't. There's no power going to it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Boring!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do we do?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well, if we could find the main power supply...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK people, let's get lookin'.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. If we can connect the power to the switch, we should be able to use the lift.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Whoa, don't look down! Anyone know where we are? Other than high up?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Maybe...somewhere around the thigh?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The thigh? You mean we ain't even half way there yet?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Stop moaning about it. Look. We can make camp over there. Let's rest for a while.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora, are you sure you're feeling OK?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I feel a bit like I haven't got used to this body yet. But please, whatever you do, don't tell Shulk about it. I'm sorry, Dunban.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't worry about it. Back when my arm was injured, it was you who took care of me.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'd almost forgotten. It seems so long ago now.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thanks, Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Doing a spot of maintenance?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yep. The sighting's been a bit off lately.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You know, Miqol let us have some new parts. I could make you a new rifle if you want.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thanks. But I want to keep using this one for now.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, get a clue, man! It's more than just a weapon to her. She can't just throw it away and get a new one.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. I suppose so.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If she let anything happen to it, I bet she'd get a whack from old Otharon.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Doesn't my man ever rest? We never know when the Mechon will strike next. Stop it! Gadolt, it's not your fault. Listen to me! Nobody knew that so many Mechon would come! More people would've died if it wasn't for you! Would their deaths have meaning if we'd won?! Hey, Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is it?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Do you want to beat the Mechon?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Of course. What you askin' that for?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? At any cost? Even if it means giving your own life?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Giving my own life? No way. I can't do anything if I'm dead. I'm gonna take down the Mechon and survive. And there's no way I'm gonna lose Shulk, Fiora or you along the way. We're all gonna win this and get out alive!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If only we all thought like you.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do you mean?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's charming.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We should get moving. We don't have time to hang around.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn, did you rest well?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah! I feel great!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looks like we're about to re-enter the Mechonis. Brace yourselves.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Got it!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dundun! You OK?\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh, it's nothing. Just my imagination.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are you OK?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She looks very tired. Should she not get some rest?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thank you. But really, I'm OK.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. We'll find a safe place to rest. We've hardly stopped since we left the village.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki tired too. Riki tummy rumble.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm with you. Time to park our- Shulk\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get down!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A Mechon assault! Can anyone see them?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Another vision? Nice one, Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. It wasn't.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That voice!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's a faced Mechon!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is there someone inside?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do we do, Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We fight. But don't kill him.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thought you might say that. Sharla!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt! It's you, isn't it? Please answer me! Let me see you! Gadolt! I knew you were alive.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is that Sharla's boyfriend?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt?!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do you mean, Lord? What's Egil done to you?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's wrong, Gadolt?! Why would you say that?! Speak to me, Gadolt! Gadolt! Stop! Gadolt...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sharla!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who's calling my name? A higher power? Like the Bionis? I do just as anyone would do. It is natural to want to change an unhappy future. If that is their will, then I choose to fight. My Monado? Is everyone OK?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That was a close one. I mean, how on Bionis did we survive that? We seem all right.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I dunno. It could be that we were just lucky. But I'm sure there must be more to it than that. Who's there?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A Machina?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are you Vanea?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Vanea? Does that mean you're Miqol's daughter?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Lady Meyneth?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're lying! Gadolt would never try and hurt us! It can't be!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is that because of me?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Mumkhar seems the more likely candidate. His attachment to us was too strong. You could say it caused his destruction.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That Xord one 'n' all.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. It's not true. My Gadolt...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sharla?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Explain it to me. I mean, why does Egil want to make us into Mechon? What's the reason for all this?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I knew it.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Of course. Initially, the Monado couldn't take a Homs life.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It can now though.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Those who share the blood of Zanza? Who is that giant? Him?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What?! Are you saying that Zanza is to blame for Mechonis' devastation?! It's Zanza's sword that I'm using! Does this mean we're enemies?! And if so, why are you...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Calm down!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry...I...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is that your plan? Lead us straight to the gates of our enemy? Deliver us into Egil's hands?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So this is the Mechonis capital.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looks so desolate. Like there are no signs of anyone living here.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It truly is a soulless city.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Here bad place. Riki want to go.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So the Machina built this whole city? Not too shabby.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looks like the buildings have been here for a very long time.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look, Shulk! Dinobeast! Dinobeast eat city!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A Dinobeast? Here?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But how?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It is a Telethia!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looks like it's stone.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why would there be a Telethia in a place like this?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why did the Telethia attack your city? Wasn't the ancient battle only between the Bionis and the Mechonis themselves?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looks like the power's up and running.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora, what's the matter?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everyone follow me.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is that?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looks like it's here. But it's just an image.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No way! Whoa, you're right!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? These are memories of a time long forgotten.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They were left behind by the Machina, before they abandoned this place so that others may know their story.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Her voice sounds like...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? In ancient times, when the Bionis and the Mechonis came into existence, I was born as well. Just as the Bionis had a soul, I came to exist in this world as the soul of the Mechonis. I created my children on Mechonis and acquired this body. They called themselves Machina. And Mechonis was transformed into a world brimming with life. The Machina gave rise to an advanced civilization and built this great city.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This city?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Can't believe it used to be so lively.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They lived their lives in peace and harmony. The gentle Machina worshipped me. Life also flourished on Bionis. The Machina generously shared the fruits of their civilization with the peoples of the Bionis. They believed their two worlds would grow, hand in hand. Then a terrible fate descended on them from above.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is that the Monado?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But why? Why would the Bionis...?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wielding the sword of light, the Bionis attempted to destroy the Machina.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are those Telethia?!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I tried to save the Machina, and confronted the Bionis. And so I confronted Zanza.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Zanza?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The battle waged on and on. Even as our life forces depleted, Zanza and I continued to fight. However, it did at last come to an end.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Giant.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This is when Zanza was imprisoned!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Taking advantage of my final blow to the Bionis, its beings took Zanza and sealed him firmly away. However, the battle with Zanza had greatly consumed my life force. I warned the surviving Machina that the Bionis had not yet been destroyed, and that one day he would be released.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm the one who released him!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I then entered a long and deep slumber, in preparation for Zanza's inevitable reawakening. It's all clear to me. What you wanted to do. Stop the battle between the Bionis and the Mechonis.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora. I see now. It was her inside you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But why did it have to be my body? It was all because of our world, because of Bionis, that this city was devastated.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Now I understand why Egil would want to stop the Bionis from reawakening.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I get it too, but how's killing any of us going to solve his problem?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Precisely. What happened to the Machina was a tragedy, but we cannot forgive the Mechon attack on Bionis.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What worries me is the Monado that the Bionis used. It's no different from how the legends describe, but still...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It must hold a deadly power.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But you have used it wisely, Shulk. It has not overwhelmed you as it did me.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He's right! If you hadn't been using the Monado, we wouldn't have lasted five minutes.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But it was Zanza who bestowed this sword upon me. The tragedy of he who wields the Monado? Light? What do you mean? We understand the history of Mechonis now. If he is willing to listen, we will try to reason with him. But if not...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Vanea...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I know Vanea said she'll try to persuade him, but she didn't sound confident.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We have to go after her.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But how do we get to the shrine from here?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Up ahead is a transporter leading to the shrine. But it's inactive. We need to trigger the Verification Devices to activate it. We'll find one at the top of each of the four pillars. If we trigger them all, we can use the transporter.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How Fiora know that?\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Meyneth's memories... She tells me these things.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Do you know how to trigger them?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Maybe my body itself is the key.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. Then let's get searching. Look out!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's him! Gadolt!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's the second time I've sensed an attack without seeing a vision first.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt, stop! Why are you fighting us?! Remember who you are!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's no good! He's completely under Egil's control now. Remember what Vanea told us!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can't believe it. I won't believe it! Gadolt, please! Answer me!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How can you lay a hand on Sharla?! You're supposed to love her, marry her even!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. You always protected me and Juju. This isn't you!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You don't have to do this! Look at Fiora, she found herself again. Whatever you are, you must still feel pain! Well then finish us off! Sharla 'n' all! We all saw you miss a second ago! Ain't you supposed to be a crack shot?! Or did that pile of junk you call a body mess up your aim?! Stubborn idiot! That was your last chance!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He's not giving up. The stories about Gadolt of Colony 6 are true.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Except... he still can't kill her. He's missing Sharla on purpose!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt... You're just like I was. You can remember who you are.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt, please! Don't you remember me?! It's Sharla!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk... Can you still use the Monado?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora? No... You're...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Even after losing all living flesh, a Homs' heart will remain. It is still present within this Face.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is that true?!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. It is clear from his actions towards you. The remnants of his heart... pull him back.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I will break the curse that allows Egil to control the Faces. I need you to buy me some time.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. We'll try! Reyn! We've got to help Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Eh?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Come on!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora? Was that you or...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? As for him...he'll be fine. Don't worry.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt! It's OK... It's all right now... I'm just so happy to have you back.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Egil...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I promise I'll be back for you. Until then...stay safe.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Drink it. You must be thirsty. Don't go dying on us. After we take Egil down, we'll get you looked at. I know a good doctor nearby. She is Machina though. Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You are Egil, leader of Mechonis. Wait. I didn't come to fight you. I didn't come to surrender to you either. I just want to know something. I've seen the legends of the Machina right here in the capital. I think I understand why you want to fight the Bionis. But why send the Mechon to attack the people of Bionis? I don't see the joke! We share the same world! The Homs, Nopon and High Entia live in harmony, so why not the Machina too? Of course.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A military strategy in which you cut the supply lines and starve out the enemy.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't understand. What?! Yes.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But that means...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What're ya talkin' about?! Are ya sayin' we're just food?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So you attacked Bionis to reduce the Bionis' power supply? Foolish? We only grieve for those we've lost, as you do! Machina or Homs we've suffered the same! Don't tell me it's different! So then... Yes, we can. To get this far... we've fought long and hard.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk... This whole thing stinks, but he's got a point!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Agreed. Egil, leader of Mechonis! The lives of the Machina and the lives of all that lives on Bionis are one and the same. We won't stop. Not until you realise that! You know, Egil. You know the reason. The golden Mechon! Zanza?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I won't let you kill Shulk! Yes... Meyneth, the villagers, everyone loved you. That is why they wished to live alongside you. It's all so clear now. To Meyneth and to me. Please, you have to listen to me! Egil! Egil!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We have to run, get out of here! The whole city's gonna come down!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Run where?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We have to get out of the city! Get as far away as we can!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt! Where are you?! Gadolt!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sharla! What're you doing?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He's gone! He's not here anymore!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's no time! We have to get ourselves out!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No! I have to find him! Gadolt!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Pull yourself together! Remember, Sharla, we've got a job to do! What's gonna happen if the Mechonis starts moving?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's gonna happen to Juju and Otharon?! Gadolt's a Homs soldier! He wouldn't have hung around here to die. He would've got out.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? All right...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right! Now come on! Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I-it's you...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt! What's happening?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's like we're floating in mid-air!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora... Are you doing this? This light... Was it you who saved us when we fell from the fortress? Meyneth? Where's Fiora?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's OK. I'm here too. After all that occurred at the fortress, my soul was exhausted. But I was revived by the cry of a young Homs. By his wish to protect you all.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If he had not acted as a shield, I would have been unable to save you. I am sorry.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gadolt saved us. Now he's...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Mechonis! Where's Egil?! Stop this! Kallian and the others are still on the sword! Our friends are going to die! Stop!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'll kill him! That murdering monster is gonna pay!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Otharon!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry. I can't do it.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That hurts!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Where are we? Alvis. Thank you.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Alvis, what happened to the allied force? That's good.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There is still time.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora? No, you're...?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Mechonis and I exist as one. Egil is using ether energy absorbed from the Bionis to force it to move. There is still time before the Mechonis fully adapts to the ether.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But how are we to get there? The Mechonis capital is destroyed. You have our gratitude. We must go there at once.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then let's get a move on. This one's for Gadolt.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hear, hear.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Too right! Gadolt's wishes live on through me. We will fight to the end.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Understood.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oi! Look at that! What the?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I know.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Vanea? Actually, I'm grateful. Thanks to this body, I got to see Shulk and the others again. Shall I call her? She is usually asleep. Maybe she just doesn't want to disturb me. It's an unusual feeling... Two hearts in one body. It's not every day you get to experience something like this. It's as if I can see into her heart. We each know what the other's thinking. But it's strange. It feels like there's a part of my heart that's hidden. It's the part that holds Meyneth's feelings, and I can't see them. Maybe it's only natural. Everyone has one or two secrets, right? But I know how much she cares about this world. That's why I'm happy to let her use my body. Yeah, I know.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Glad to hear it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's great news.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We won't let 'em down. This is one fight we can't afford to lose.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Heropon Riki all set! Riki bounce some heads!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Really?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're a tough old timer.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's this? The old fossil wants to tag along? As long as you don't slow us down. We're here. Everyone ready?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ready.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Anytime!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Leave it to Heropon Riki!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey, Shulk. What is it this time? Stop worrying and come on.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Monado isn't at full strength. I don't know if it can beat Egil.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You talkin' about that Apocry-whatchamacallit thing? Don't worry! He's no match for all of us together!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? At least the previous encounter allowed us to gauge how he fights. We won't make the same mistakes again!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Now ya tell us! I wish you'd said something earlier. Shulk! Did ya hear that?! Looks like you'll get your wish!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Something's not right.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Egil... He called me Zanza. The same Zanza who devastated Mechonis. What did he mean?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He was just trying to get to you.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I told you before, right? I haven't had any visions lately.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But I still know...if I concentrate... I feel like something will happen, and it does...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are you saying you don't need a vision to know what comes next? Pull the other one.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn, you're going to scratch your head with your right hand.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Huh?!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What are you on about, Shulk? Stop playing around. Ohh... But... How did you do that?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can't work it out. Ever since we came to Mechonis, my abilities have been changing. Why would that happen? If it's true that Zanza used the Monado to lay waste to Mechonis, then is it right for me to use it? Is what I'm trying to do really the right thing?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk... Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's wrong?!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No! No! It's happening to him too. Shulk! Hold on! You all right?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. It's OK. I'm fine now.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Man...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Your control of the Monado has always been flawless. It never crossed my mind that this would happen to you too. Are you sure you're OK?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Perhaps you are suffering this much because you put all your energy into fighting the effect of the Apocrypha.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ain't you learnt yet, Shulk? How many times do I have to tell ya? If something's up, you've got to spit it out, man! I ain't just talking about visions. I mean whatever's on your mind. All right?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry, Reyn.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't go apologising. It's my fault for not noticing. Let's get one thing straight. I've still got your back.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thanks. No. This wasn't caused by the Apocrypha. It's a completely different kind of power.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's happening to me?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I know I should be glad we made it this far, but if we don't find the Apocrypha Generator soon...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Exactly. The fight against Egil's not going to be easy with the Monado in its current state. And we don't know what kind of toll it'll take on Shulk's body. We have to destroy that generator.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's up ahead.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's a strong energy coming from up ahead. That has to be it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Really?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then this is it! Egil's gonna be scrap metal when I'm through with him!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's just as I thought. The Monado feels the same as it did before the Apocrypha took effect. No, it feels even more powerful. The Bionis' Monado. And this Monado. They have to be connected somehow. Why am I remembering that dream? Why now? Without the power, I can't stop Egil. I have to concentrate. All I have to think about is how to stop the Mechonis. If the Monado does bring about the end, then I know what to do. Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, what were you thinking about?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nothing.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So. It's like that is it?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Really, it's nothing.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Listen, Shulk. If it's too hard for you handle on your own, talk to me!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You can tell any of the others as well. We're all here for you. Don't forget that.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're right. You're here for me.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Of course! And don't overdo it, OK? We all saw what happened. Is your arm OK?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, it's not bad. I'll live.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oi, you two! Is something up?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No, it's nothing. Come on.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk... You can...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wait. It's moving!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You mean...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No, it can't be!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Move out! Don't forget we've still got a job to do!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right! What?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nyapakapow!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Chew on that, Apocawhatever! We did it, Shulk! Shulk? Oi! Whoa!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's happened to the Monado?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It must've changed just as the generator was destroyed. It's amazing.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Now we're talking! Next up - Egil!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Can you go on?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Me? I'm all right. Come on. We have to stop Egil. Egil! Stop the Mechonis! There has to be a way for us to live in peace! There's no reason for us to fight! You must stop this now!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's that?! Egil! You'll regret this!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Egil! Stop this!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Incredible!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Whoa!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Don't do it!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That voice. Who is that? I will. I'll kill him. A thousand times. Yes. I want to. I'll kill him. For Fiora. For the Emperor. For my home!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That is why they wished to live alongside you. It's all so clear now. To Meyneth, and to me!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No! This isn't what I want!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! No!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I've forgotten all about that. I realised that we both share the same pain. Egil, I don't have any reason to kill you. I know. But I won't do it. I can't kill you, but I can stop your blade. And I'll do it. Over and over again, until... we understand each other. OK? I don't understand. Does being controlled by the Monado mean you will eventually become Zanza? What do you mean? I don't know much about any curse. For now, all I can do is this, Egil. We can live in peace again.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson! Why?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oi, old man! Are you completely out of your mind?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who are you?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Zanza's disciple?! Egil, what do you mean?! Dickson, what are you?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Get away from him! No!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Wait, who's this guy?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do you mean?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Zanza grew tired from our battle, and then the High Entia ancestors trapped him. His flesh was sealed away on Prison Island. His soul, and hence the Monado, was confined to Ose Tower.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? In those ruins?! But what does this have to do with Shulk? What are you saying?! You planned all this when you found Shulk? What?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk was already dead?! That's impossible! We grew up together!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But why use Shulk? What was it that made you choose Shulk as your vessel?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So then... Shulk's ability to use the Monado...\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And those visions that he used to save us!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You evil...!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What are you gonna do, Dickson?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Bionis!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Bionis moves!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's... the Monado!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why?! Egil and Shulk had put their differences aside!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Zanza! Reyn, now!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How could you do this?!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I finally understand. The futures of our children belong to them alone. Though we are their creators, their lives are theirs to control. Even if the passage of fate is as you have decided, I will teach you the strength of their will to resist. Zanza. If you choose to deny the existence of every living being but yourself, then I choose to fight. To fight for them! That's right. We won't let you erase everyone's futures! They are living beings! If you cannot understand this, you have no right to call yourself a god!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Zanza! Meyneth!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Zanza disappear.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He's gone. And things ain't looking good for us!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The...the Bionis! That light! What's happening now?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I understand your feelings. Leave it to us. We know what we must do. We will do all we can for the people of Mechonis.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Egil... Go in peace.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Let's go! We're leaving the Mechonis! Reyn! Take care of Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Got it.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You OK?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Good. It still works. The whole place is going to blow! We must return to Junks via the Central Factory!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Let's go!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dundun, what about Egil?\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He will fight Zanza to the very end. But we have our part of the bargain. Once he's gone, we're the only ones left. Let's move, everyone!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Mechonis!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look starboard! What's that cloud?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's Telethia!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson! That's enough! Why, Dickson?! What made you like this?! Shulk looked up to you, respected you!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson! Don't let Zanza control you! Wake up!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Before we were born?! I'll kill you!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Brother!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Kallian! Dickson! He works for the Bionis! He shot Shulk in the back!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They are...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Telethia!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Brother! Lorithia! Let him go!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Explain yourself!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It can't be. Say it isn't so! Brother? Brother! Brother! Just hold on! I'll find a way to save you! Don't say such things, Brother! Brother! Brother!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Where am I? Oh. So I'm... What was I doing? What was the purpose of my life? No. I've got it wrong. I was never alive. It was Zanza! All along! I... Everything I did was... That voice!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk. Here. Miqol made you a wonderful new weapon. Since you lost your Monado, I mean. It uses the latest Machina technology. Use it when you wake up. Then let's all go on living.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's ironic. We want to escape Zanza but we can't leave his body, the Bionis.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well...this is our home.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I cannot be sure, but I believe not. All those who survived are part Homs like me. If they ever do transform, I will be among them. If that time comes, you know what to do. Everyone is obliged to accept their fate.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No way! There's no way Kallian would leave the fate of the High Entia to you if that was gonna happen!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Precisely. And Melia... If we are to survive, we must fight Zanza and the Telethia. It may not be the case with all of them, but a large number of Telethia were once High Entia - your subjects and your brethren.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I am prepared for that. Even if it means harming my brethren, it is for the protection of the survivors. That is the final wish of my father and brother. I will fight! To free the souls stolen by Zanza.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You are a fighter, Melia. We will need all your strength in the fight ahead.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How's Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He's going to make it. His wound has closed. I think Meyneth used the last of her power to protect him...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So he's OK.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Linada is tending to him now.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He won't wake up. It's like his consciousness has sunk to the bottom of a cold, dark lake. I keep saying his name but he doesn't respond.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Zanza's gonna pay for this! We're backed into a corner, but we'll give it all we've got. What do you mean by that, Alvis? You've got it backwards, man. Just 'cos he thinks it, doesn't make it so. We decide whether to keep living or not.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I agree. Even though he is our creator, that does not afford him the right to take our lives on a whim.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So you think we should just shut up and die?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You are mistaken if you think we will simply accept such a fate and wait to die.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We'll never stop fighting. Not till the end! It ain't the outcome that's important. It's the will to fight back. Alvis! Whose side are you on?! You scared or something?! Frightened of a few Telethia?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry. I need to go and get some air.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora, are you all right?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Guess I wasn't hiding it well. I didn't want to worry anyone.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It must be difficult living with that body.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm getting more and more used to it. But people still look at me funny. Ah, it's not that bad. It feels pretty comfortable actually. I don't need to worry about food or anything like that.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I see.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This body... The energy from the chest component made it work. It turned out to be a Monado. Such a strange feeling.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A Monado? Was that the Monado that Zanza took from Meyneth?! Will your body cease to function?!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'll be fine for now. There's still some stored energy left.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But then what?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia, if I ever... Please take care of Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Don't talk like that! How can you ask me such a thing?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm sorry.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's no need to apologise.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're right. Thank you, Melia.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If Shulk awakes, will you tell him?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. He worries too much anyway.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He does worry. It's just like him.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Actually, I'm already dead. I have been since the Mechon attacked.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But I'm happy now. This body has given me the chance to live. Maybe I don't have much time left. But at least I can be with Shulk for a little while longer.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Do you feel that strongly for him?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. That's why I'll fight on, and help him in any way I can. Let's get back. Everyone will start worrying.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. You are right.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And Melia... Can you keep it secret from the others?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You do not want them to worry. I admire your strength.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Maybe I'll tell him. But only when the time is right.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I won't say a word. I'm nothing compared to her.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? A siren?!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! Let's hurry back!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That siren! Is that...?! Let's move!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Gotcha!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm going too!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But Shulk needs you!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I know, but I can't just stay here. What if something happened to you? What would I tell Shulk when he wakes up?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora, are you sure?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Lots of Dinobeast!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look, it's him!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So he survived.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shut up!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You will not mock the memory of my brother!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's my decision. Our destruction was always inevitable. Everything we did was meaningless. That's because... And we're the source of that risk? But why? I couldn't save everyone. Our own path... That was always how it was going to be. If I'd wanted to walk the predetermined path, I wouldn't have come this far. Even with the odds stacked against us, even though I can't see the future, I'll keep walking. My own path. That I decide. Fiora. Reyn. Dunban. Sharla. Melia, Riki. We all feel the same. Alvis. Are you-\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? These things don't give up!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki never lose. Riki protect Colony 6!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right! We can't let them get any further!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You know the drill. Take them down!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh yeah! Get away from him! Forget about the Monado, kid. More space between Zanza and us, the better!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If Reyn's got time to sound off, we must be doing OK!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We are doing OK!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn is correct. Perhaps we relied too much on the Monado and Shulk.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right! We've chosen to fight the Bionis. We have to manage on our own!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This is not the end!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban! Are you OK?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I just overdid it. Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm OK. I can still fight.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Never!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look out!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Lots of Dinobeasts!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It truly seems as though everything is going as Zanza planned. But our hearts and minds... They still hold the will to seize our own destiny! No matter how hard you try to break us, the future is ours to shape, Dickson! Always!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thank goodness you're here!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That was awesome!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry for worrying you all.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk. Welcome back.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, look out!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! How'd ya do it?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I could see it. The future! I don't have the Monado, but it came to me, Reyn. From within!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Nice one! Looks like we're back in business!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What?! It can't be!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Alvis! Not you too!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No! How can he be one of them?!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Alvis! Is this the only reason you served under my family?! You traitor!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oi! Say something! Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Leave it. It doesn't matter what he is. That doesn't change anything at all. Does it, Alvis?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Telethia. He's...!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So you're just another one of Zanza's lapdogs!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get ready, everyone.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Show them no mercy.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That all ya got?! Not so tough without your pet, are ya?! I'll show you the will to survive! Get back here!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. You can bet on it. And we will be the best guests you ever had. Dunban, have you seen Fiora?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I have. She said she was going out to get some air. I don't think she went far.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thanks. I'll take a look. Fiora, here you are.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ah, Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's wrong?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's nothing. It's...so peaceful. It's hard to believe that we defeated a horde of Telethia just minutes ago.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Zanza wants to finish us all. So he can make the vision he's had come true. We're in the calm before the storm.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? They'll be back, won't they? The Telethia... To remove us all from this world...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I won't let that happen. Whatever the future holds, we can never give in. Not to Zanza... No, not even to our destiny.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I wonder why Alvis said what he did.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Which part?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Does this world belong to us, or to Zanza? Why would he side with Zanza? Power? Or maybe he wants to live forever.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who knows... But I don't think his motives are that simple. I'm sure Alvis has some kind of plan. Otherwise, why would he speak to me in my dreams?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He spoke to you in your dreams?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's another reason why I have to find Zanza. I have to find out why.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You and me both. I must fulfill Meyneth's wish! Shulk? You wanted to speak to me about something?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh, that's right. Linada's looking for you. She wants to examine you. She's back at Junks.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh... Hey...umm... Can you go ahead? I'll go and see Linada in a minute. I need a few minutes to myself.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. No problem. Take your time.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thank you. What can I do? If I go to see Linada, she'll find out what's happening to my body. I need to come up with a good excuse. Please... Let me be with Shulk just a little bit longer...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Zanza is inside the Bionis. I just know it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson must be there as well.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. And Alvis too.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's all good, but how do we get to them? If they're inside the Bionis, we're gonna need to dig a pretty big hole.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? How long that take? Riki get old soon!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then that means...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah! Time to knock some heads!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki never lose! For Riki family, Riki win!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We must show this god our unyielding will to survive!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The suffering of my people will not be in vain!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The crimes against our friends will not go unpunished!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ready. We go to the Bionis' chest. We will free our world from Zanza's curse! It's the inside of the Bionis.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looks quite different from when we entered via the marsh.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The Bionis is regaining its biological functions.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Must be 'cos Zanza woke it up.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then we find Zanza, and stop him.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That voice... It's Lorithia! Show yourself!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Quit yer yapping and show yourself!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Lorithia! What are you planning?!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Forget her for now. We must push on to the heart.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? All right.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm still alive. I won't die. Not yet. And that's why we're here.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everyone who lives in this world has a life. So it shouldn't be threatened by anyone. We'll never give in to Zanza.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's...\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Kallian!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Brother! Brother! Brother? Is that really you? I have longed to see you. Brother, I must apologise. To you and to everyone. I am a princess. But I brought misfortune upon the High Entia. I... I... Brother. Yes. I have done nothing. This is your destiny. Accept it with dignity! Brother. Thank you, Brother. Your words will stay with me forever.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? His words?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki heard. Riki heard Melly's brother. Kallian say 'hope of Bird People'. Where Melly's brother? Riki not see him, but Riki hear him.\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki. You, too, heard his parting words. Thank you.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Melia...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Thank you for your concern. I am all right. Let us go and secure the future my brother so hoped for.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We will. Together.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do you mean?! I'm gonna...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Come on, everyone! We've got to get to Prison Island!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hey! Is this?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's Prison Island. So it has sunk into the Bionis' head.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dundun, Riki feel funny feeling from above! Riki instinct say Dickson is there!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes, I agree.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Start praying to Zanza, Dickson! We're coming!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Come down here and say that!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What on Bionis is that?! Stop these games, old man!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everyone, be careful!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Monster want to eat Riki!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This thing is no match for us!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Where are we? What is this place?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It looks like a cathedral. There's an altar over there.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? These have scary faces!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We better take a look.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You see something, Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This indentation... It looks like something should fit inside it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yep! Riki feel like something here!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's probably a way up to the top.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Could it really be that easy?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's no use thinking about it. Let's search for whatever fits into the gap.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I can sense Dickson. We must be near the top. If we proceed from here, we will be unable to return. Are you ready to go on?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No, I need more time.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I understand. We'll be ready.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes, I'm ready.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Aren't you scared?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I would be lying if I said no. But still, we must go on.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Agreed. We know what we're fighting for.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We decided ages ago!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Oh, sorry. I just got caught up in the moment.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Come on, Dunban.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Right! Let's go! Time to seize our destiny!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dickson! Waiting for us to fight you? We'll never do that. I know. And I must thank you for granting me such power. It's all down to you that I'm standing here ready for you now. Dickson! If you're so determined to stop us, then we will kill you!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Not her power. I've inherited her memories. That's why I fight you!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why are you fighting? You're helping Zanza to create a world where nothing exists. What could you possibly hope to get out of it?! You're wrong! Is that your reason? For fighting? Meyneth wished for a world where the peoples of Bionis and Mechonis could live hand-in-hand. You will never get away with this!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It can't be!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'm fine. I'll carry on fighting beside you until the very end.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Be careful! Melia!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Stand up, Fiora! Did you not say that you wanted to be with Shulk?! Do not throw your life away for this scoundrel!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She's right! You have to take what you want! There's no point in dying!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Show him what you're made of! Come on, man! You don't need the Monado to take down this piece of scum!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki know! Riki know Shulk brave! Riki want to see the old Shulk! Shulk is real Heropon!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk! Real power comes from within! Believe in your own true strength, Shulk!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everyone...\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk. It's time, Shulk. Let's finish this.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I will not fail. With your faith in me, and our strength combined... We can do this. Face me. Stand and fight! Dickson!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Get back here! You expect us to let you go?! What?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Enough. It's Zanza we're after. Not him.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, his wounds...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Where are we?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What happen?! It night-time! Is Riki have bad dream?!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look down! Look at all the stars!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We're not on Bionis any more. There's no land or sea either.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's beautiful.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is that a ball of water? It's you!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is it, Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That voice! It's Zanza!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But he looks different.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Meyneth's Monado.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You gonna give him a reward?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Are you so arrogant to believe that the High Entia, no, all life on Bionis, are nothing but your playthings?! Yes. You don't know how it feels to have slain my brethren after they had transformed into Telethia!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So this is the arrogance of a creator. But though you feign omnipotence, the High Entia still confined you to Prison Island! That is how limited you are.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Until I was born.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Meyneth...\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Never! I don't wanna be your vessel or your disciple! I just want to live my life as a Homs. In a world without you! Is that why you laid waste to Mechonis?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? So you're saying us Homs are next in line, eh?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You're wrong! Meyneth chose to exist alongside us! She grew to consider us her friends. You should have accepted that! But what you were hoping for was not friendship. You wanted worthless slaves. Our lives as food! We will not allow it! We cannot! We will stop you! I don't know. It comes from the bottom of my heart. It shows me my enemy. It reveals the future I must change!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? The future we see is not set in stone. There are infinite possibilities based on the paths we choose. You should be well aware of this notion. For that is how you have always existed!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why should we care?! What's important isn't whether you can see the future or not. It's the will to make a choice, and the strength to seize your destiny! Our time has come. Our destiny is our own!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It is not only you that has the right. Every living thing has the freedom to choose the path they walk. And that is the future!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That voice! That is something I decided long ago! Today, we use our power to fell a god, and then seize our destiny! Where am I? Your home? Whose voice was that? And that voice. It's Meyneth! And that was how we were born. Bionis being filled with life, and the Telethia coming to wipe it out. It was all the will of Zanza. His future and our future. It might have been possible for them to coexist. New god?! Alvis, what are you? Alvis? I don't know. All I wanted to do was stop Zanza having his way. That's all. I cannot be a god!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Too right! You're great 'n' all, but there's no way you're a god.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Everyone!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look, don't worry, Shulk. None of us want to be gods anyway. And I don't really know what the future holds. But we just want to live our life as it comes.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Eating grub, sleeping, laughing, crying. Sometimes arguing. Sounds all right!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. He's right. And being with the ones we love. That's enough.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Even so, we change little by little. Every day is a little different from the last. We do not know what the future will hold.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? More fun not knowing! Riki want to have fun!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Life's little surprises are what makes it great. We don't know what's going to happen. It's worrying sometimes, but it's also exciting. Don't you think?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. Isn't that called progress? Aren't we all continuously evolving? I'm not sure we need a more dramatic change than that.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. You're right. Little by little. Each day as it comes. That's how we should live. That's our world. Alvis... It sounds like you don't think I can make my own decisions. I'm supposed to be the god! I won't decide. The future should be decided by each and every person in the world. And so, what I... No, what we wish for is... A world with no gods!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ah, yes. That's excellent. So, you can take the materials to District Four? Thanks to Melia and Vanea. The High Entia and Machina have some amazing technology. Hear, hear. And may it last forever.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Dunban?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora! What is it?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Have you seen Shulk?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He just left. I don't know where he's gone, but he was with Reyn and the others.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? OK. Thank you.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fiora!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's nothing. Good luck!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? If you're looking for Shulk, he is not here.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Amazing. It's like you've got eyes in the back of your head. What were you looking at? The sea?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I wasn't looking at anything in particular. If anything, Fiora, I was thinking. Thinking about the future that awaits us all.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Wow. You're so much more thoughtful than me.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Really? I don't think so. I was just answering your question.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? But I know what you mean. You're right. We've been through a lot.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. We have. I am grateful to all of you. It is because I met you that I experienced so much. And it is the reason I am here now.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. We're happy you're here too. Thanks, Melia. For everything. I'm glad I met you.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And I you.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Almost got it!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Go Reyn! Go Reyn! Riki really hungry!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Go on! Put your back into it, Reyn! Are you OK?!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It's salty! What's up with the water being so salty?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn bad fisherman! Riki want eat big fish!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Give us a break. You try next time, furball!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Fishing is Reyn's job! Riki's job is eating!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hang on a sec. Isn't Oka gonna have a massive go at you if you don't go back to her with 14 fish to feed all your littlepon?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Riki forgot! Wifeypon very angry if not catch more fish!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It ain't me she's gonna be angry with.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn catch fish! Catch fish now! Fish! Fish!\", \"completion\": \"Riki\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Here you are! The breeze feels so good.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? It does.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What is it?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That hairstyle. It looks good on you. That's all. Yeah.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Really? I was thinking about growing it out, but... Hey, which do you prefer?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Both, of course.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Come on. What am I supposed to say to that?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Sorry. OK. It's great like that. Don't change it.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I'd forgotten what it feels like to do this. I wonder what the future has in store for us.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Who knows. I'm sure it will be full of ups and downs.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ups and downs?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't know what the future holds. But that means I can imagine the possibilities. We can achieve anything we put our minds to.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah. You're right!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Do you remember what the Monado, I mean Alvis, said to us the last time we saw him?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. Of course.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? One day I hope I can meet them all. The people of this endless world.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Me too. We will. I know it.\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? We'll meet them. And whatever happens, we'll face our future together. Who's this?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Ain't she the one who attacked us in the capital?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Tyrea! What are you doing here?! You're hurt.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Watch it! Oh!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Tyrea. What happened?\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is she dead?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. It looks like she's just passed out.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Let's get her to the infirmary. Reyn!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Come on, why me?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Please.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is she OK?\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Her injuries aren't severe.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? When the Bionis awoke, the ether flow around the colony became unstable. Maybe that's why she lost consciousness.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. That's not what I meant.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You mean why didn't she become a Telethia?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Precisely.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? For pure-blooded High Entia to become Telethia, the ether energy surrounding the Bionis has to be above a certain level. Luckily, the level of ether energy here is not as high as on the upper regions of Bionis. That may be what kept her safe. Or perhaps...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Perhaps what?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No, it's nothing.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Something about this makes me feel uneasy.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I know what you mean. We'll have to keep an eye on her recovery.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Why does she hate you so much, Melia? You're both High Entia. Is being pure-blooded really that important?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Tyrea's birth mother is most likely my step-mother.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? You don't mean...Yumea?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yes. I heard about it from Kallian after I returned from the tomb. Mother was leader of the Inquisitors, a secretive organisation operating in the shadows of the imperial household. The group plotted to maintain the imperial bloodline through a clandestine ritual - a ritual where Tyrea was conceived.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And she was secretly raised as an Inquisitor assassin.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Hold on a sec. Are you saying that Tyrea is Kallian's half-sister?\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? That's right.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Then isn't she in the same position as you?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Mm-hmm. Tyrea! You're awake! You're wrong! I'm...!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I don't buy that for a second!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Reyn?!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Pride of your people?! How about you're jealous of Melia! Ain't ya? You're envious of her, right? Of how she lives her life. You just want everyone to feel sorry for you for being in the shadows all your life. I'm sayin' that you'll never have a life like Melia's! You don't have the faintest idea why Melia's been fighting. Even if you'd been born in her place, the Emperor still would've chosen her as his successor. Succeeding the imperial line ain't all about blood. It's about takin' on the will to do whatever it takes for your land, for your people, when the time comes. That's what makes Melia different from you!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Both of you, stop this! This is no time for pointless bickering.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? He's right. We survivors shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves. Right, time's up! I want the room cleared out.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, OK...\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? And you. You need to calm down and get some rest.\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What's going on?!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Look! Over there! The colony!\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Telethia!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Guys! She's gone!\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Tyrea, you mean?!\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Could that Telethia be her?!\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? No. At least, I'm fairly certain.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's no time now. We must pursue it. It must be Tyrea after all!\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What do we do?! Do we have to fight her?\", \"completion\": \"Fiora\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? There's no time to think about it. Ready yourselves!\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Shulk, I must...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? I know.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Tyrea! You're safe? *gasp*\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yumea?! But why? Didn't she feel betrayed?\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Her final wish?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? This is my responsibility. Father entrusted me with the empire and its people. What I believe in is the will of those struggling to survive. I have to fight if I am to convey this to the next generation. Besides, Yumea is your birth mother. There is no need for you to carry out such an unpleasant task. This is a duty that my father and brother conferred upon me. Tyrea... I believe you and I are alike. Tyrea...\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Well, there she goes.\", \"completion\": \"Reyn\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Is she going to be OK on her own?\", \"completion\": \"Sharla\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? She'll be all right. We and Tyrea share the same goal. Our paths are sure to meet again.\", \"completion\": \"Dunban\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Yeah, you're right. Melia, what did you mean just now? When you said you and Tyrea are alike.\", \"completion\": \"Shulk\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? Tyrea must be half Homs, just like me.\", \"completion\": \"Melia\"}, {\"prompt\": \"Who would say this? What?!
