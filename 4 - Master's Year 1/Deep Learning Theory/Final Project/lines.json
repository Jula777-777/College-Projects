I wonder what kind of people made it."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I ain't got a clue."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Let's keep moving. The Ether Cylinders are up ahead."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Right! Right here! Thanks for the help, Shulk. I'll start collecting them up. You two hold on a sec."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "It's full of Ether Cylinders... Hey, why do we have to come all the way here to get them? Isn't there an Ether Cylinder fuelling station in the colony?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Well. Refining the ether takes a long time down there, and sometimes cylinderisation fails. And there are so many cylinders here for us already. It's more reliable than making them ourselves."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Right. And Colony 9's Anti-Air Batteries and mobile artillery are standardised for these cylinders, so they can be used straight away."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I see. You know, this place is in good condition considering it's ancient."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It might be... That there's some form of technology being used to preserve it. It's just a shame we don't understand its secret."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Shulk...?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "But I'll solve it one day and show you. If it's just technology that someone created in the past, it's not incomprehensible. We'll come to understand it one day."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Don't go trying too hard. We can come and get Ether Cylinders whenever we need them. Besides, it's a good place for Defence Force training."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Yeah, so good that you didn't even want to come here without Shulk to back you up! Anyway, did you collect the cylinders?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yep. All done. Thanks."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Just come by yourself from now on."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Shh, be quiet..."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Are they Mechon?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I don't know!

I've never seen anything like them."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Could they have been Mechon?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "No. I think they were something left by the civilisation that built this vehicle."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "They didn't seem like Mechon to me. But why did they only show up now?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I don't know. But they were probably built to protect this place.

It's not working!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Oi! What d'ya mean?!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "How can that be? The Monado should cut through Mechon with ease!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What is that light? Other Mechon don't have that. Could... Could that light be why the Monado has no effect?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Shulk! Reyn! Get down! Stay back! I'll take it from here!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "No! You can't take any more!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Everyone. Get away, right now!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What did I just... Fiora! Get back!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I won't let you hurt any more people! We will save Colony 9!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora! Get out of here! Run!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "You want more?! How?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora! No! I'll kill you! Die!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk! Get back here!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "No! Fiora..."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "The breeze feels so good."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. I'd forgotten what it feels like. I never thought it could be so quiet here."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "You're spending too much time with Reyn. You're getting used to all the noise he makes."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah, maybe."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "It's so peaceful. You know, Shulk, I hope every day can be like this, always."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Hey. Have you been to see Dunban?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I just can't do it. You got more guts than me."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Not at all. It was him that consoled me."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I guess that's the type of guy he is."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. Even without the Monado, he's the strongest person I know. Uh..."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Shulk. How are you holding up?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I'm fine. But...you..."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I will shed no tears."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Huh?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "A year ago, I felt the same sense of deep loss that I do now."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "The Battle of Sword Valley."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "After that battle, many of my friends did not make it home. While I was being brought here on that stretcher, they were all I thought about. But I decided I would not cry. Everyone who died in that war had something they wanted to protect. Family, friends, loved ones, their home... So they fought to protect them. And we won. No matter how painful, no matter how hard, it's nothing to be sad about... I decided that there and then."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Dunban!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, Fiora would tell you the same thing. She wanted to protect us. Or rather, she wanted to protect you. And you're alive now. So I will not cry."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "OK."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Remember the gift of life that Fiora gave you, and treasure it."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I...I can't say that I understand. But...I hope to, some day."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "That is all I ask. Believe me, I am always just trying to understand."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "'Treasure the gift of life that Fiora gave you.' He's one of a kind, that Dunban."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I've made a decision."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Huh?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "My purpose in life - I will pursue that faced Mechon."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "They attacked our colony, killed Fiora. I will find that Mechon - find it and destroy it. Destroy them all! What are you laughing at?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Sorry, sorry! It's just a bit weird. I never thought you'd be the one to say it!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "So you agree?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "'Course, man. I'm just surprised you came out with it first!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You thought I'd try and talk you out of it! 'That's not what Fiora would want!' That sound right?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. Something like that. I thought you'd give me a hard time."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "In my head, there are two versions of me. One of them is saying that. It's telling me, 'Listen to what Dunban said.'"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What about the other one?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It keeps shouting, 'Make them pay!' 'Destroy every single one of them!' And it won't stop getting louder."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "That doesn't sound like you. Sure it ain't my voice in there?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Might be! It's a bit of a loudmouth!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "There you go then! So when are we heading off?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Right now."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Perfect. Right then."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Look after yourselves, boys. As soon as this heals, I'll be right behind you. And then we will seize our destiny. Together."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's all very well going after that metal-faced Mechon. But shouldn't we have some kind of plan?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "How about checking out Colony 6?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Colony 6... The only other Homs colony left."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Colony 6 is on the way to Sword Valley, where there's supposed to be a Mechon base. If that's where they came from, maybe the people in Colony 6 saw something."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Good point. They might even know something about that metal-faced Mechon. So we go past the Mag Mell Ruins and up through Tephra Cave. Then we should arrive at the Bionis' knee."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. And if we can get to the knee, it ain't far to Colony 6, right?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Sounds like a plan! Let's head to Colony 6. This door... It was closed when we came past before, but it's open now."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Maybe it was programmed to open up in case of Mechon emergency. The way to the Bionis' knee is just ahead. You ready?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah, let's go. An ether lamp."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Don't traders use these things as guideposts?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. We can follow them to the Bionis' knee."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "OK. But if armed traders need guideposts, it must be pretty dangerous in here. Let's keep our wits about us."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Definitely. What the...?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Look at the emblem. They're traders from Colony 6. No wonder it's been so long since the last delivery."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn, their injuries..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "They weren't made by no Mechon. It was probably the monsters that live here. Man, that's grim. I don't wanna go like this. Not even killed by Mechon, just some monsters in a cave."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "They probably had families...children..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Maybe. It wouldn't surprise me. But why do you say that?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "No reason. Reyn, shouldn't we return them to the Bionis?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Oh, right. What's born from the Bionis is returned to the Bionis. That's the way of the Homs. That was way harder than I thought it'd be. I'm just about ready to collapse!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Let's take a rest. If the monsters in here killed all these traders, we need to be at our best. I'm wide awake, so I'll take first watch."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Thanks, man. The nap'll do me good. Shulk. My turn."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Awake already?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Didn't sleep a wink. And I still feel like I just did one of Vangarre's drills!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Heh."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Hey... Why do you think the Mechon attacked? Are we just food to them? Or, what, did we do something wrong? Sort of reminds me of the battle between the Bionis and the Mechonis. I wonder if it's anything to do with that?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Well... It's hard to believe that living things are just a source of energy for machines. There has to be another reason."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "The Mechon killed Fiora."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You know what? I'll never forgive 'em. I don't care what their reason is."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Hmm. When it happened, the Monado showed me that Fiora was in danger. But I couldn't save her."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "It's not your fault. Just 'cos the Monado showed you some future, that don't mean you could do anything about it. You did great. You fought them off. I couldn't have done that. You know, I've been thinking about it. Why you can use the Monado, I mean. Dickson told me. You're a survivor from the Monado expedition team that went out 14 years ago. There was a blizzard or something and your mum and dad died. And then Dickson found you and brought you back."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That sounds right. I was pretty young, so I don't really remember anything."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Is that why you do it? Why you're always helping Dickson with his research and trying to figure out the Monado?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Maybe. Part of me does see it as something to remind me of my mum and dad. But mainly, if it really is the sword that the Bionis used to kill the Mechonis, like in the legend... I want to work out its secret. That's the real reason."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I've got it! You were chosen. By the Monado."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What? Chosen?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Don't you see? Not even Dunban can handle it. It ain't chance that you can and he can't. I'll take the next watch. You get some rest."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "OK, I'll try. Night, Reyn. I... The True Monado?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk! Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk! Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What're ya playing at?! Give us a hand!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I'm sorry, Reyn."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Don't worry about it. It looked like you were having a nightmare!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Really? The True Monado? Was I dreaming?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What's with you? We'd better get a move on."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It wasn't a dream. Was it a vision? What should I do? I could tell Reyn. But... I don't know..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What on Bionis are those?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Monsters' egg sacs...I think... But it looks like there are Mechon parts inside as well."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Man... What kind of monsters are they?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Probably some type of Arachno... Reyn! Get back!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Argh! Urgh! Ahh!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn! No! If that vision comes true, then Reyn...! I've gotta find him!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You things just don't give up, do ya?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn! I've gotta hurry. If I can get up there, I should be able to reach him."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk! Where are ya?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn! Reyn!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "There's too many of 'em! I kill one, and ten more pop up!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn! No! Not that way! Reyn!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What's this?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "The power of the Monado?!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Look out!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Glad one of us figured out these things would try an ambush. Let's do this, Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Right!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Looks like the Monado works on more than just Mechon. I gotta say, that's pretty awesome!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn... I just realised something."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Huh?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "The future I see... It isn't set. I think it's more like a warning."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "A warning?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah... A warning about what will happen. What will happen if I don't do anything, or if I can't do anything. So I can use this power to change the future. And that's exactly what I intend to do."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You've got my vote. And if you really can do that... I think Fiora would have liked it too."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Right, let's get moving. We're nearly at the Bionis' knee."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Wow!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "No matter how many times I see this, I never get used to it."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "On the other side of those clouds..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yep. It's our enemy. Mechonis."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Our enemy..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "If we just came up the Bionis' shin..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Then this must be its kneecap, right?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yup. Which means Colony 6 is up ahead!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Looks like we can climb up there."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Great! I love a good climb. Shulk! Look over there."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Smoke..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Maybe someone's got a fire going. Hope they're cooking up something good!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's hardly a good spot for a barbecue! Come on, let's take a look."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Someone's left a buggy out here."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That's strange. Who would just abandon a buggy in this place? And it's pretty new."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Is it brand new?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Not brand new. But it's in very good condition. You wouldn't just abandon it. So what did happen to the driver? There's a boy! He's being attacked by monsters!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You saw it happening? Where?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I don't know! But it was near some water."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Near water... But what made you have a vision all of a sudden?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Maybe it was triggered by touching the buggy."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Well, we'd better find him. Let's search everywhere round here where there's water!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "OK!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk! Over there! You all right, kid? That can wait. Go! Get outta here! Leave these guys to us."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Let's do this!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Ready when you are!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "OK. It should work now. I fixed the circuit, but it's out of ether. Change the cylinder and it'll be as good as new."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I think it's time for the introductions. I'm Reyn. He's Shulk."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Pleased to meet you. Your camp?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "How about it?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Let's take him up on the offer. I'm surprised there's a Homs camp here, but they might have some information."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I suppose."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Juju, can you tell us how to get there?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Then what? Got it. Now, let's make a move."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "That gear. You must be survivors from the Defence Force! Is Colony 6 OK? Did Gadolt make it?!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Hold on. What're you talking about?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We've come from Colony 9."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Colony 9? Oh, so you're not from Colony 6. Thank you for helping Juju. I'm his sister, Sharla. Did you now? Well, all right. I suppose that's only fair."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Did something happen? To Colony 6?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Actually, we're heading there ourselves."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Colony 6 has been... Our home! It's been occupied by the Mechon. I'll tell you about it inside. Follow me. We had already fought off the Mechon a year ago, at the Battle of Sword Valley. It left us with a false sense of security. The Colony 6 Defence Force didn't even notice the approaching Mechon. By the time the air-raid siren sounded, a swarm of Mechon had blackened the sky. They ate people and burned our buildings. Me and Juju dedicated ourselves to evacuating the children and elderly. I don't know what happened next."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's just like what happened to Colony 9."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "They attacked your colony as well?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yes. It's good that you managed to evacuate so many."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "We have Otharon...the Colonel... to thank for that. Him and Gadolt."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "This Gadolt..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "He would have been my husband by now if not for all this. Cheer up, you two!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Er..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "We can't lose hope just yet! I'm certain Gadolt and the other soldiers are alive. They're still fighting. I can feel it."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Hmm?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You bet! We're up for some revenge. I bet we can even get your colony back!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "There you go showing off again..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Juju! The people here need us! How many times do I have to tell you? Even if that's true... No, especially if it's true! We cannot expose the camp to any more danger."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Kid! You oughta know how Sharla feels. Watch your mouth and have some respect! Maybe I was too hard on him. Shulk?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Reyn, you really remind me of Gadolt when you get angry."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I do?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Gadolt's taken care of us ever since we were young. I always saw him as a big brother really, but he was more of a father to Juju... He'd call him 'kid' whenever he told him off, just like you did."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I don't think I'm ready to be someone's old man just yet... Shulk? Did it happen again?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You had another vision?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Oh no!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "No! Juju! The buggy's gone! He's going to Colony 6 on his own!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Stupid kid!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We have to hurry. Something bad's gonna happen."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What did you see?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "A deep valley... Everything's engulfed in flames... There's a black shadow... It kills Juju."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Is it the Mechon with the metal face?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Where does it happen? Is it near Colony 6?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I'm not sure. I think so."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Let's get after him, Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Hold on a second! What was all that about?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I know you won't believe this... but Shulk can see the future."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "The future? That's not possible."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That's what I thought too. I still can't explain this. But that vision will come true unless we stop it."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "So you're telling me Juju's in danger?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Believe it or don't believe it, that's your call. But I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for Shulk's visions."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Juju... OK. I can't say I believe you. But what have I got to lose?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I like the way you think!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Sharla, you're..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "What?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "No, nothing."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What are you doing? Let's go and find Juju!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "When you talk like that you sound just like Gadolt! That's how I know it's not worth arguing."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What am I, some kind of Gadolt substitute?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That thing kills Sharla too. I saw it in the vision. But I can't stop her coming with us. I don't know how I can protect her. But I have to do it. I WILL change the future."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Sharla, do you know which way Juju went?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "There are quite a few ways to get there from here, but he's in a buggy, so I think he'll take Raguel Bridge."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Raguel Bridge?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "It's not far. It's a really old bridge. Built around the time Colony 9 was founded."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "OK. Let's make that our next stop."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Sounds like a plan! Sharla, you stay back. Leave any monsters up to me and Shulk."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "What, you think I can't pull my weight in battle? I've got field experience as a medic. If you get hurt, I can use ether to patch you up."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Nice! I'm always getting roughed up. You'll be a big help! Hey, Sharla! Look!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "It's Juju's buggy!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Juju!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What is it?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's Juju!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Shulk! Is he OK?! Tell me!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "There's a Mechon... It's taken Juju!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "When?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I'm not sure. But I don't think we've got much time."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "You said you saw a deep valley, didn't you?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yes."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "There's a place like that just up ahead. And it's even on the way to Colony 6. That must be the route Juju's taking."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You sure? No other deep valleys round here?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Not as far as I know."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Well, Shulk?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Let's move. That has to be where Juju is."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Is this the place you were on about?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "This is it all right. At the end of the road there's a path to Colony 6."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "But there's no sign of Juju. If my vision was right, he should be around here somewhere."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "I'm sure he would have gone along this road. I just hope nothing's happened to him yet."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Any chance he went up that way?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "It's not safe around here. I doubt Juju would go off the beaten track if he could avoid it."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Got it. We'll search along the road."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Juju! Juju! Hold on, I'm coming!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Wait! Sharla!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Juju!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Another new symbol's appeared on the Monado! Can I save her?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Shulk?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Its tentacles could come out from under the ground at any second. One false move and you're done for. Wait for my order! Reyn, you got my back?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "'Course! Leave it to me!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Amazing! I didn't know you could do that!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's not me. It's the power of the Monado."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "That's right. And the light swirling around us... That's the Monado 'n' all. Sharla! Let's move! Is it down?! Get back here!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's up there! Let's go after it!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Right!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Juju! Are you all right?! I'm so glad you're OK."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Hey! Looks like we changed the future! What's up?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Well, it's just that... That can't have been the Mechon from my vision."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yeah, weren't it supposed to be that one with the face. I guess we changed more than we expected! Shulk?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "No. Something's not right."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Juju!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "No! It's not him at all!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "But this one's got a face 'n' all!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What? It spoke! Juju!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Juju!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You pile of junk! Let him go!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn! Better watch your back!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Got it! Cheers, Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Why? Why can't I use the Monado?! It's only the ones that have faces. But... I can still see what it's going to do! Just like before!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk! Leave these to me! Go take him out!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Got it!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Now!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Right! It's just bouncing off 'im! Shulk! Look out! You! You're gonna pay!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Juju... Gadolt! Otharon. But... Promise me. Promise that you'll meet us outside the colony. I... Just make sure you get out of here alive! Gadolt. A promise is a promise. And until I see you again, I will protect everyone. Juju! Juju! Where are you?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Hey there. Are you all right?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "The sleeping princess awakes.

We want a piece of them too."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Really...?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Truth be told, we were gonna leave without you.

And it's just... I never imagined I would go back to Colony 6 like this. I'm sorry. Lost myself for a minute. We can get to Colony 6 from the valley where Juju was taken. It's this way."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "This is Colony 6?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "It's like a fortress. Did people really live here?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "So much has changed... It's only been a month."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "We'll find Juju and then smash some metal!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Wait! We can't just rush in."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "We could enter through the mine."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Mine?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "There's a massive ether deposit under the colony. The first settlers here built right on top of the mine. That's how we got our colony. The mine is like a network of tunnels. It's much more complicated than the colony streets. They can't have figured it all out in the space of a month."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "So..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "She means it's the best route if we want to remain unseen."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "You're catching on."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Great! So how do we get in?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Through the Drainage Outlet. It's just up ahead. Guys! Kill the noise."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "A Mechon."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "I can't believe they've taken the mine too!

Don't start panicking now."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Reyn..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You said yourself, they can't have seized the entire area, right? I bet you they're holed up someplace safe. Juju is alive, and we're gonna find him."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That's why we're here. You can count on us."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Yes, it'll be fine. Reyn... Shulk... Thank you. An Ether Rifle? Gadolt!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Sharla, wait!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Gadolt! Otharon!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That's our cue, Reyn."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Oh yeah!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Sir.

What do you mean gone?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Some of the people in Colony 9 got eaten..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Sorry. Forget I said that."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Are you sure? You can count on me. What?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You say something, Shulk?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "No. It's nothing. Forget it."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Hurry it up, slowcoach!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "What's wrong?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What can it mean? 'This is for you.' Is Juju already dead? Or is he going to be killed? Is that why Otharon... But then... What does that mean? If we keep moving, is Otharon really going to die? No!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What's wrong Shulk?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That's not it! I... It's just that... Listen... Maybe we shouldn't just rush in head first."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "We got this far."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I think we should observe them and plan our attack afterwards. It's just..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Sir! What's got into you?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "A vision again? Don't tell me, another death?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I knew it. The Shulk I know doesn't just chicken out for any old reason."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "This vision... Was it like before?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Kind of. I saw an underground ether river. And Otharon..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "An ether river. You know what? That sword lets you see the future. All that power and you still keep getting it wrong."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Better to use my brain than my fists."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, I may rush in head first, but at least my head's useful for something."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "OK, OK. I get the idea."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I ain't done yet! You're useless on your own, Shulk. That's why we're here."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn, I..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Next time you have a vision, you tell us. We bear the burden together, as a team. You have a vision you don't like, we'll change the future together. Got it?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Got it."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What was that! Say it like you mean it!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I got it, all right! Next time, I'll tell you."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "He's right, Shulk. You two saved Juju once before. I know we can do it again. I believe in you."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Thanks. They're right. We'll change what happens. Anyway, I didn't see Juju and the others dying. There's still hope."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "We're here. The Central Pit."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Where are they all? I don't see anyone."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "We'll take that lift."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I'm ready to mash some Mechon!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah! Juju, Otharon... Just hold on!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "No... They're gone. So whose blood is... Oh no!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, isn't that...?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's him all right. He's the one who took Juju!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Juju and the others! Tell me where they are! Juju!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Murderer! Xord? So you have a name? What's he talking about?!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Gadolt... The others... I swear I won't stop until I've scrapped each and every one of you!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Get behind me!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn! Sharla! We are Homs. And we won't just stand here waiting to be eaten! How about this! It's the same as before. The Monado's useless against this guy. No! We'll never get to Juju at this rate. I've got to think of something! Otharon, don't do it! At this rate, even if we save Juju, Otharon's gonna be..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You see a vision you don't like, we'll change the future together. Got it?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Change the future. Yes! That's it! Reyn! You grab Juju!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, what are you doing?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Juju! Wake up!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Sharla, leave the rest to us. Hang in there you old fool!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Otharon! Hold on!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What a shot!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We can change our destinies.

It's giving way!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "He's gonna..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "But I... This isn't supposed to happen. Otharon!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "That was close! You wanna hurry up? My arm's about ready to drop off. Save the thanks for Shulk and his vision. As soon as I saw an ether river, I knew this had to be the place."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Juju... You're safe now."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What did I tell you? You and me can make anything happen."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah, you were right. I didn't really do anything. I couldn't have done it without you guys."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Time to head back to the camp."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We'll need to get Juju some medical attention."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "There's a freight elevator on the next level. From there, it's an easy route out of the mine. As long as it's working..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "We'll know that when we get on it."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "You make me laugh."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Well, I'm right, ain't I?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "You're absolutely right. We need to move on and stop worrying about every little thing. Come on, guys."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Good. Works perfectly."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You see! What did I say?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "We're all impressed."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Hey, why've we stopped?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I don't know. But I think we're about to find out."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Not him again."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "This one doesn't give up!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "This is our chance, guys."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Did we get him?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "True power? What do you know about the Monado? The truth? When you became like this? What do you mean?! Xord!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Get back! We smashed that bronze idiot. Now the people of Colony 6 can rest in peace."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. Are you OK? Thank the stars you're all right. Just outside Colony 6. Thanks to Shulk and Reyn we destroyed that thing. But not everyone made it."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Forget about it, kid. We settled the score."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yes, but there's still no sign of that Mechon with the metal face. He's the one we're really after."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's him! Metal Face!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Not just him! A whole bunch! And tons of 'em look like Xord! This one can talk 'n' all!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Talk all you want. Because those words will be your last!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I'm gonna..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Dunban!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "How did you...?!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Sorry to have kept you. Looks like we were just in time."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "There's no end to them. Where are they coming from?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "I can take the smaller ones. But the rest'll be like fighting Xord over and over!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "If only the Monado would work on these things!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Focus, Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Look out!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Reyn!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You may be able to block a projectile. But let's see if you can block this!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You OK, Dunban?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "What are you? That light... Everyone! Fall back, now!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Now's our chance!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "We must be outside the tower."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "What or who are you?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You will pay for what you've done! You will know the pain and suffering you caused the Emperor and Fiora! Another one... You're not getting away!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Get back here!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, Reyn, let it go!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You've got to be kidding! He's the one who killed Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Know your limits. We'll get another chance."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fine."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "That thing saved us. Whatever it was."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Wait... Dickson? Dunban? You're the heroes who risked your lives a year ago, in the battle to defend the colonies."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Dunban, Dickson, thanks for helping out back there."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I don't believe we did anything."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What was that thing?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "A Telethia. So that's what it's called."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "A mystical beast that protects the Bionis."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "So, what's your plan from here? Follow that metal-faced machine, I presume?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What else? He's gonna pay for what he did to Fiora."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Well then. There's only one place he'd go. Galahad Fortress in Sword Valley. A year ago, those things were building a huge fortress, right in the valley. Tactically, it's an excellent location to launch attacks from. I feel there's a strong chance they've now finished building it. That would explain why both colonies were attacked recently."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "So it's settled. Bash down a fortress and smash some metal brains!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Easy, Reyn."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "There's somewhere else I need to go first."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "But what could be more important than... Wait... You saw another one."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I was somewhere very high up. I was fighting at the peak of a huge tower. Fighting Metal Face. I heard a voice, and then the Monado's power was unleashed. His armour instantly gave way. The Monado doesn't work on Metal Face at the moment, but if that vision comes true..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Can you remember anything else from your vision?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I remember a huge horn. That's it! As I fought Metal Face, I could see the Bionis' head."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Prison Island?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "The High Entia are real? I thought they were a myth!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "The High Entia? I'd dismissed them as folklore as well."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Have you ever met one?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Wow! Dickson, man, you're just full of surprises!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Stop your whining. You do it 'cos you enjoy it. And you make a tidy profit. Well then, Shulk, what's it to be?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We'll head there."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "There are alternatives. We could abandon the colonies, find a place the Mechon will not discover and live in secret."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I realised something when we were fighting Xord. Wherever we go, they'll follow. We can't run from these things. We must fight on."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I see. Then I am obliged to join you."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You want to come with us?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Scared I'll get hurt?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "No way! We know you're stronger than anything! Right, Reyn?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You bet!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I've recovered a great deal since we last met. And that miserly old coot over there made me this. Sharp, light. Perfect for cutting through steel. Show me a Mechon and I'll slice it in two. I might not be in peak condition, but I'm useful."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I can't thank you enough."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "We're in it together now."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You can count on us, Dunban."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "So you keep saying... We're at the bottom, so I guess the only way to go is up."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "The lower back... I've never seen anywhere like this!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Wow... I've never thought about going inside the Bionis."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You really know all the fun spots, eh, Dickson?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We'll push on. No matter what."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Everyone, look. It's a group of Nopon."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What d'ya think they're up to?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "They must be here for a reason. Let's go and ask them."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Good idea. This lamp... It has a very strange glow."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Good for them."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "The breeze feels so good. It's so peaceful. You know, Shulk, I hope every day can be like this, always."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You will pay for what you've done! You will know the pain and suffering you caused the Emperor and Fiora! Dickson. I owe it all to you. If you hadn't found me that day, I wouldn't be here now, discovering the world. Don't be. I don't remember much at all. But I know that my mum and dad left me it. The Monado was their final gift to me. At least, that's how I used to think of it. That's why I wanna discover its true power and help defeat the Mechon. But so far I've just been creating piles of Mechon scrap. This sword... There must be some way... Sorry, guys. Didn't sleep a wink."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Right then. Time to move on. How far now?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I understand. Thank you for everything. No, it's OK."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "I want to help Shulk. The Mechon must pay for what they did. And I'm sure Gadolt is still alive somewhere. If he is, I have to find him. Are you sure?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "No way, kid! You just need to shape up like me! You'll do us proud, kid."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Good luck, Juju. Dickson, are you leaving too? Yeah, I guess you're really needed at the colony. You can bet on it! We won't let the colony down."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Thanks for the heads-up, Dickson. The lift don't work!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Looks like it's been broken for a while. We'll have to find another way up."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Another way? You don't mean climb up there?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "We may have to."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Come on, you can't be serious? Why'd someone build a lift that don't work?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "No complaining! Let's start looking for a place we can climb up. Reyn..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Ready to go, Shulk?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. But just hold on a minute."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "What is it, Shulk?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's about the Monado. I'd like to ask your permission to use it a little longer."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Why ask me?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "The Monado was your sword. But...I need it to achieve my goal. So..."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Don't sweat it. You are far more skillful at wielding that thing than I ever was. Keep it. It's yours. Besides, I have a new sword. That old coot had the decency to forge this one for me. I owe it to him to make the most of it!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Dunban..."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You've fought your way this far. That is proof enough the Monado has accepted you. Don't take my word for it. Believe in yourself, Shulk."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Believe in myself?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Never lying down, never giving up. That's our pride and strength as Homs. And we have to make sure those metal monsters know it."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You're right!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Time to move, people. This Prison Island Shulk saw in his vision isn't getting any closer."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What is this place?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "It's giving me the creeps."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "At a guess, I'd say we're inside the Bionis.

Let's just keep moving."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Right."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "No, Aizel. Do you really expect me to leave you, run away and save myself? I will not. I cannot return to the capital with this monster still standing! Aizel! Hogard! Aizel! Hogard! Garan! Damil!

I'm sweatier than a Brog's armpit!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "We'll have to search for the best route.

You will know the pain and suffering you caused the Emperor and Fiora! A silver-faced Mechon... And who was that girl? These visions show me people and places I've never seen. If only I could find out what they mean. We could use them to our advantage."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Look over there! A rope bridge! It looks Homs-made."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Not Homs, Nopon. Though a lot of them have settled in our colonies, the Nopon are originally native to Makna Forest."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Do you think they'd know the way to the Bionis' head?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I can't say.

You!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk? What's wrong? Another vision?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Kind of. I'm not sure.

It's well-known that Homs are strongly affected by ether levels in the environment. But I've never seen symptoms like this before.

Symptoms range from fatigue to nausea, but in this girl's case..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What can we do?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "We're gonna need Water-type Ether Crystals.

I'll fire them into the air and the dispersed ether will heal her."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "That's what I thought."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "But the problem is the crystals. We can't just use any old crystal, they must be as pure as possible. This area must have a water source nearby.

Would a waterfall produce pure crystals?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "I can't think of a better place."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Then it's decided. I'll search for the crystals."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Hey, you're not going on your own!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I'll be OK.

Take care man!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Who are you? Hello. Alvis? Um. My name's... How did you know that? I know you from somewhere... What are they? Alvis, get out of the way! I'll deal with this myself! From the left? Then I'll go... How?! Now from above! It can't be! I saw its movements before it struck. How can it...? Telethia? You know about my visions? How could you possibly- No, Alvis! Stop! You don't know how to- A new symbol! That was amazing! What was that light? I... control it. By the light of the Monado, I will stop them. Thank you. Hey, wait a second! More importantly, where on Bionis did you learn to use the Monado? A girl? Alvis. How do you know so much about the Monado? Who are you?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk! Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That's Reyn!

He's the one that... Alvis? But he was..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "There's no one here."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I'm telling you, he was right here. He even taught me how to unlock a new power from the Monado."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Just you and me, Shulk. Ain't no one else around.

I'm not lying!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "OK, OK. I believe you. And while you were having fun with your imaginary friend, did you find any ether crystals?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yes. Good quality ones too."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Perfect. Come on. We should hurry them back to Sharla. Hang around here long enough and we'll get whacked by an imaginary beast!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I'm not lying! Alvis... Who are you?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "An enemy that renders your visions useless. This forest holds many surprises. Not least creatures we've never seen before.

You and Dunban are the only ones I know that can wield the Monado. How would this guy know how?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "OK. Locked and loaded.

My name is Melia. Forgive my indiscretion. I have not had the pleasure of coming into contact with a male Homs."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Coming into contact?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Hey Shulk. You're creeping this lady out."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Shut up, Reyn!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "This large one is far worse."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Me?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Melia, is it? How did you get here, then? What, is there no one with you?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I must apologise, but my situation does not concern you. And I shall not be divulging anything to common passers-by."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Duly noted, your ladyship. But if I were to be so bold, I'm guessing that you didn't come here alone and you weren't just taking an afternoon nap."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "And what, may I ask, are you doing here? It is rare to see Homs venture this deep into Makna Forest."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We're travelling to the head of the Bionis.

Thank you, Melia! I'm Shulk. Pleased to meet you."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, ah yes. Likewise."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "She's a bit high and mighty, but she's a Homs too, right?

That's where we've been heading.

This is the entrance to Frontier Village."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "So this big tree is where the Nopon live?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I wish to speak with the village chief.

Chief, will you hear my request?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Bird Lady?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "They are at one with the Bionis. They sacrificed their lives so that I might escape. But this is not my reason for coming. These Homs need your help. Will you be so kind as to listen to their request? They require safe passage to Eryth Sea. I have unfinished business in this region. Once these Homs are safely on their way, I shall be on mine as well."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "That girl...something's troubling her."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "We found her half-dead and all alone. But I don't suppose she'll tell us the reason any time soon."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Maybe we can help. I'll go and talk to her. Melia. You're welcome to come with us. Is it true? Were you alone in the forest?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "That thing must be stopped by my hand. This is my pledge to those that have died."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Wounded by a girl... You don't mean you're going to fight the Telethia?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "How do you know of the Telethia?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "When I went to collect the ether crystals, some Telethia attacked me. I managed to destroy them and get away."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "You defeated Telethia?! Who are you? The Monado... So that sword can..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "To tell the truth, they were the Telethia's spawn. Someone told me the primary Telethia is healing somewhere in the forest. It was you, wasn't it? You hurt the Telethia. Melia?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "The Telethia escaped from our homeland, and I am tasked with killing it. It cannot remain free. For the sake of my people, and the Nopon, it must be stopped."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Melia, we can help you defeat it, if you like."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Out of pity?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "No."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Why, then?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's just... I...I want..."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Speak, Shulk. Or I shall be forced to summon the Nopon chief to interpret for me."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I would like to help."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "What could you possibly gain from aiding me?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I saw it. At the top of a black tower, you and I were fighting together. Fighting that faced Mechon. I also saw you fighting a huge Telethia."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "It threw me the first time 'n' all."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Forgive me, Shulk, but what are you talking about?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk can see visions of the future."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "See the future?! And you expect me to believe this rubbish?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Believe what you want, lady. Same as I tell all the non-believers."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "That'll be me then."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Oh yeah. In any case, the only reason we got this far was 'cos of Shulk's visions. If Shulk says he saw you in a vision, then you must be important to whatever happens next. And if you're tough enough to fight a faced Mechon, you're all right in my book."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You've got my vote. A lady should not go unaccompanied onto the battlefield."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Excuse me! I am quite capable of dispatching the beast alone! I require no assistance of any kind! Chief Dunga, I..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You do know we're listening? A Nopon hero? Now this I have to see!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Don't be like that.

Take this, furball!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "New Hom Hom friends! Meet this year's legendary Heropon, Riki! Riki live to serve!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "A Heropon, you say? Not sure where you'll come in handy, but the more the merrier. Shulk, are these Telethia as strong as they sound?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yes. They're quick as lightning and can read your mind."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "A mind-reading giant bird. No problem."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I can see their movement through the Monado, but even that's not enough to get the better of them."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "And we're going up against the daddy version. No one blink for a second."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "OK."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Eyes wide open!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "And don't forget that Melia is our only chance of making it to Eryth Sea.

Friends get ready, friends help Riki get ready!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You want us to get equipment for you?"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Riki's friend right. Hom Hom clever! Friends meet Riki when ready. Then friends and Riki leave together."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Big attitude for a furry footrest. \"Dinobeast is big and scary!\" Great. That'll come in handy."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Is it just me or did we suddenly become Nopon mercenaries?"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Ready to go! Come new friends, Riki's adventure begins!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Riki? You do know where the Telethia is, don't you?"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Of course Riki know! Melly! Riki hear you hurt Dinobeast!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I did. But only a little."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "When Dinobeast hurt, Riki know it go to place with ether crystals. Friends and Riki go to place with crystals. Then we find Dinobeast! Chief tell Riki! Chief always right!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "So you do know a thing or two about this monster. Guess we'll be searching for some ether crystals then."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Riki? Why are you the Heropon?"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Why? Because Chief Dunga choose Riki!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "He chose you? So you weren't chosen from birth?"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Friend wrong. Chief choose by instinct!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "By instinct?!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Why friend surprised? Chief have sharp instinct. Chief be village seer!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "So that's how you became the Heropon? Can't argue with that."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "But he is kind of...compact...for a warrior hero."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Riki owe lots of monies to village. If Riki defeat Dinobeast, village promise to forget my debts. So Riki like being Heropon! What is this? Riki never see before! This not Riki's Makna! Riki never see before!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "To think it has caused this much damage."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "What do you mean?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Are you telling me the Telethia did this?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Telethia absorb and drain the surrounding area of all its ether."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That's it! The Telethia is sucking up all the ether, which is causing the natural environment to change."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, the Telethia can read your mind. Expect it to know what you will do before you do it."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I know. I'll aim for its antenna and stop its ability to read my thoughts.

I see..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Stick together everyone."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Dinobeast! Big as Riki imagined!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "The Telethia! I take this chance to bring vengeance for my brethren and fulfil my duty! Shulk!

She's nifty with that staff."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "I knew it. She can control ether energy without using catalysts or rifle shells."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I've heard that such people exist. But I never thought she would be one.

I can tell they were dear to you. I know only too well that desire for revenge. And the crushing pain of losing those close to you. I can't stand by and let another person experience what I have.

Permit me to act as your guide to Eryth Sea."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Of course! We'd love you to."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "But I must warn you. Eryth Sea is vast. Do you know where you wish to go?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "There's a dark tower at the head of the Bionis. I saw it in a vision. That's where I must go."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "A dark tower? Then we need not search at all."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "So you've heard of it?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Heard of it? I have seen it. A dark tower at the head of the Bionis. Only one place fits that description."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "So you know it?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I believe what you saw was Prison Island."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Prison Island. Dickson said the same thing."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Indeed. Melia, have you ever been there?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I have not set foot upon the island, but I know of it. Prison Island is sealed. No one may enter without imperial sanction."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Imperial sanction? That means we'll be needing someone to grant us entry. I've heard that Eryth Sea is home to an empire ruled by the High Entia. They might be our best chance."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "You are knowledgable for a Homs."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Sanctions, empires? Anyone help here?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "A sanction is permission from someone important. An empire must be a place ruled by an Emperor. In other words, we need an Emperor's permission to enter the island."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "This Emperor... Is he important?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Long before we Homs built the colonies... A group of so-called royal-types or imperials ruled our lands. Think of them like the heads of our colony. But with much greater influence and power."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Now I get it. Dunban knows more than a textbook!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Are you kidding? That's first year Homs history, Reyn!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I might have slept through that class... So when do we get to meet these High Entia folks?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "You are so... Forget it."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "First we must travel to the imperial capital."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "We'll see how easy it is to see this Emperor."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "My promise was to be your guide.

All go to Eryth!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Jump? In that? You're nuts, furball!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "You have nothing to fear. This will take us to Eryth Sea."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Who would've thought Eryth Sea was right on top of Riki's village. Dive deep enough, you can reach their tree!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Perhaps you should try?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Might do. Haven't decided yet."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Is something wrong?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Aren't you curious... About why we're going to Prison Island, I mean?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "It is not common for Homs to visit this region. You may have good reason, but forgive me. I do not pry into other people's business."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "It's definitely bugging her, Shulk."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "How dare you! You clown!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's OK, Melia. We're not strangers anymore."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Well, I... You are right."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "So then you'll listen to our story?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Yes. Tell me why you are here."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Basically, it all started when..."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I see. I had heard about the Mechon assault on the lower regions, but did not know the situation was so grave. How lucky we are..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Hey, what's that?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Is that...?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "You are looking at Prison Island."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "So that's Prison Island..."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Yes. And that is the imperial capital, Alcamoth."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "It's not just me, right? A floating city is a bit weird?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Built with superior defences in mind."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Incredible. What technology makes this possible?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I do not know. And I have never had the need to."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You don't know? It doesn't freak you out?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You can eat bread without knowing how to bake it.

Fly?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "There is a transporter up ahead. We can use that."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "We've been deep sea diving, now we're gonna fly? This place gives me the creeps. But I guess we don't have a choice. Right, onwards to the capital!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Still..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What is it, Dunban?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "It's a sight to behold.

They must be High Entia!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Lady?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Huh."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Thank you, Captain.

Your Majesty, concerning such debts, there were others who aided me. Shulk and his companions? Shulk's weapon... Do you mean the Monado? Why?! So you intend to keep them confined? Father! I mean... Your Majesty! I assure you Shulk is of pure heart! I... Brother. Me? And not you? I don't know what to... But the soldiers... I am not fit to rule. I should visit their families and beg for pardon.

He's gonna let us into Prison Island."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. Not at all. I too must apologise for meddling in your customs. We should not have interfered. Yes. The Mechon devastated our homes, and we lost many loved ones. It is. I do not want to hide our true intentions. Our very existence is at stake. What is it? Yes, it is told to us as children. The two fought and died, killing many creatures in the process. Their remains became our worlds, bringing forth new life on Bionis. That's how we were made. Alvis told me the same thing. But why is this happening now? We used it because we- You're talking about total extinction. Then you'll help us? Your Majesty, we need imperial sanction to enter Prison Island. Will you permit us entry? I saw it in a vision. We will fight a faced Mechon. They must pay for what they did. Is it connected to the awakening of the Bionis? I understand. This is not our homeland. If you decide not to let us go, I will accept your decision. It's OK. Yes? It would be my honour."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Wow! Take a look at that! A High Entia air show!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Bird People fly higher than Nopon birds!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "They've got some neat tricks.

Are you with me?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Of course!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "We are Homs. Do what you must. But your laws don't concern us. No apologies needed. So, Melia, what's it to be?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "We go to Prison Island! Prison Island is just ahead."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Do we need to use the transporter?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "We do. But first we must unlock the seals."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Seals?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "We'll need to unlock two seals to reach Prison Island. Then a door will appear before us, showing the way."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Got it. Move, everyone! Mechon! And something we've never seen before!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Big fish coming!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Can anyone explain what this thing is?!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I believe it's one of the oldest creatures on Bionis.

To find that they were trapped on Prison Island..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Was it protecting the island?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "That would imply it's sentient. I believe it's responding to something primitive."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Primitive?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "It doesn't care who or what we are.

I've seen this thing somewhere before..."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Dinobeast! Dinobeast!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You might be right. It reminds me of the Telethia as well."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Did your ancestors build this island?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "No. The stories tell of this place existing long before my people.

Well, we'll know soon enough, I suppose."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "There! An engraving by the forefathers. I've seen this engraving around the capital. Many researchers have tried and failed to discover its meaning."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Hey, Shulk. That symbol."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah... It's similar to the Monado's symbols. There must be a connection."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Connection?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "The sealed door of Prison Island. It is said that only a true successor to the throne can open it."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Then the Emperor must be inside."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I believe so. Forefathers. I, your descendant Melia Antiqua, stand before you. For the sake of our world, release the seal!

But why are you imprisoned?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You're telling us you beat the Mechonis with that tiny thing?!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "That can't be true! Our forefathers would have had better reason!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Shackles? You mean... These shackles... They must be the reason the Monado can't hurt people as well. Does that have something to do with the faced Mechon?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Don't do it, Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "But Melia, why?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Something's not right.

No, Father. Father!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Emperor! Emperor. I... failed you. Zanza! You're alive! Give me the power I need! What?! Zanza. Mechon! It's not over.

Why did this have to happen?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Father... Don't say that! I don't care how improper it is. Let me cry.

If you need me, I will be at your side. But you are an individual. You are Melia Antiqua. And you can't let them get away with this!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "You're right. My foremost concern is making them pay."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Friends act strange! Are friends sad?

Then I can't imagine how Dunban feels."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "What did he mean?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Fiora is Dunban's sister."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "I didn't know!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Is this Fiora...important to Shulk?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Important?! She's more than important! She's the reason we're out here!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "If that really was Fiora, why didn't she reply to me? Fiora... I'd better talk to Dunban.

Was everyone worried?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Of course. Me especially. It's just... I've been thinking about Fiora, and I can't help wondering..."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Wondering what?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You saw how Fiora acted. It was like she didn't even recognise us."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Yes. It's unsettling. But Shulk, don't get me wrong. I'm not sad. Even if she doesn't recognise me, I'm glad to know she's alive."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Dunban..."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You see, Fiora was born many years after me. And not long afterwards, we lost our father to a Mechon. It was left to me to protect and raise her. Almost like a father."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I was always jealous that she had you as her brother."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Ah yes. You and Fiora used to be inseparable."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I need to tell you something. I always thought, if Fiora were to be with anyone, it should be you."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What? But Reyn hangs out with her just as much as me."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Yeah, he does. But Fiora doesn't like him in that way."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Oh, I see."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "He's a nice guy. Reminds me of myself when I was his age, all reckless and hot-headed. Probably why he's not right for her. Listen, Shulk."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yes?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "A lost life can never be returned. But she's alive.

I guess you're right."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Fiora and I have spent our entire lives together. The memory of that can't have disappeared completely. It's up to us. We have to help her remember. Help me, Shulk. Help me get her back!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You know I will."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "OK. Let's go tell the others."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Hey, they're back."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Have you gathered your thoughts?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Yes.

Your Highness, does this mean..."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Brother..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I need time before I make a decision."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I do not believe that to be true.

You wouldn't think twice otherwise."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I just don't know."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Find her, Shulk."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Melia...I..."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I used to believe my father did not love me. Until the day he died. If you do not grasp the importance of loved ones until after they are gone... That is simply too late."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You're right, Melia. I've made up my mind. I'm going to get Fiora back!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You don't have to do this. I'll go and look for her myself. The burden should be mine."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "No. I want her back as much as you."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Leave the ambassador stuff to me, Shulk. I'll probably make a mess of it, but we're a team. You can count on me."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I am afraid that is my duty, Reyn. I am of both High Entia and Homs blood. I am the crown princess, and of mixed heritage. Thus, I am best suited to carry out this task."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That means we won't..."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Yes. I will remain here. We must say goodbye."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Is that what you really want?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Yes. But promise me when you find her, you'll come back. I'll be here waiting for you."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I don't know what to say. Thank you. It's probably a good idea if I go and tell Kallian myself."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I am sure he already understands. Besides, it's likely that the ministers are harrassing him at this present moment. We should spare him any further inconvenience."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Then this is goodbye."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Yes. Come back as soon as you can. We are in great need of your help."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Got it."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Ahem..."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Why are you still here?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Listen. I'll keep an eye on Shulk for you."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Whatever can you mean?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "It's a risky strategy, letting Shulk go off and just hoping he'll come back to you."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Shulk and I are merely..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Yeah, yeah. But remember! The longer he's away, the more chance his feelings for you will fade."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "But-"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Once we find this Fiora, I will personally whisk him back here in a heartbeat. Don't give up!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I appreciate it."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Great! Don't worry, Melia - I'm on your side!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Brother? It's not what-"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I'm sorry, Your Highness. About your offer... We must...humbly decline."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I stay because I must, Brother!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "There's two Melias?"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Reyn wrong!

Your Highness, that means a lot to me."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "That is one cool prince."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "If only someone had his sensitivity..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Sensitivity? I'm sensitive..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "The jury's out on that one. That's a relief."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Thank you, Kallian.

I will return victorious with Shulk."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Do you want to come?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Then there's no point in wasting time."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We'll join you as soon as we can."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You see.

I feel it. Our tragedy unfolds once again. Indeed. I do not doubt that Egil, too, is aware. However, why free the Monado? Zanza must realise it is now a double-edged sword. And what reason could he have for choosing the boy? What is this? I am experiencing feelings for the boy? Vanea. Your swift repairs are appreciated. I wish to see that boy again. To meet with the one who wields the Monado. Is Egil aware of my reawakening? Then there is no need to worry. I shall meet the boy. Besides, the Monado will draw him to me."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I could go for a hot cup of Dickson's homebrew right about now.

So this is where the Monado was kept? My dad took it from here... Have you always been able to see the future? You told me you are from a long line of seers. Did you have the ability from birth? And the ceremony was held right here. I hadn't really thought about it. After I grabbed the Monado, I just saw things. You mean the Monado. My visions, under the same principle, are there to disrupt the future. The future would be changed. Is that how Zanza planned to defeat the Mechonis? But why go to such lengths?

And then you will know the shame of all that you have done, traitor!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That light!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "What the?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's not like the other Mechon. Leader of Mechonis. So you're the one who controls the Mechon! Why?! Why do you trap Homs in machines? What do you want from us? Why make us fight for you?!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Get your hands off her! Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Mumkhar!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We're coming. And we won't give up! Fiora, we will find you! Fiora!

We ain't got time to be hanging around here! I dunno what's happened to her, but that was Fiora. No doubt about it. You know what that means?! She ain't dead! We've gotta get her back!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Get her back... Right! We've come too far to give up now!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Then we'll go to Mechonis! And find Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yes. We will get Fiora back."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Whoa! What the?!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Is all that big sword? If is then ouchy ouch!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "The sword of the Mechonis."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "The entire valley below... The whole thing is its sword!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Something seems unnatural."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "What do you mean?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Look. That flowing light. From the way it glows, it has to be ether. But it looks like it's being drawn in by something."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "By the fortress! It should just be up ahead."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Father once told me that the Mechonis absorbs the ether of the Bionis and uses it for sustenance."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "So the Mechonis feeds off ether. Then undoubtedly the ether serves as the Mechon's energy source as well."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "It looks so big, even from this distance. The fortress must be enormous."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Galahad Fortress - the front line base of the Mechon. The Mechon that attack Bionis must all come from here."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Then there's a high probability that he's there. The golden Mechon that took Fiora.

I was hoping for some new stuff!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You cheap old man! Yes. They made Mumkhar into one. He was the one who attacked Colony 9. Aren't you surprised?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Sorry? Thanks for coming this far. We'll be fine. We can handle ourselves."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Agreed. We will infiltrate via the ether inlets. If I'm right and the Mechon do feed off ether...

You take care as well."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Looks like it's just us."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Right! We head for the hilt of the sword - Galahad Fortress."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "OK!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "One year on.

Can we get in through there?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "It looks as though it's unguarded. It should make for a decent entry point."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Now's our chance, Dunban."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Yes. But don't lower your guard. The Mechon may just be hiding. Mumkhar! How could you? How could you do this to your own kind?!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Oi, beardy! You're talkin' pretty tough there! Don't be so sure you can take us all on by yourself!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "What's that sound?!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You scumbag!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's just like with Zanza!

There's something different about them!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "How can that be?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You monsters!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Mumkhar! You're gonna pay! Yes. This is the power of the Monado! You wanted it, so now you can have it, Mumkhar! Die!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Stop!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Get out of my way! Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's Mumkhar... He's not a Mechon!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Have you forgotten everything he's done? Where is your killer instinct?! Now is the time!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I hate him, Dunban. For what he did to Fiora. And the Emperor. So of course I want to get my revenge!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Shulk..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "But... Face Mechon are not like the others. They're people! Like us! Are you really willing to kill another Homs?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Yes. Sometimes needs must!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Even if it's Fiora? What then? When we set out, I wanted to destroy all Mechon. That was my aim. But now... I know that there are people inside. I have to know why. What's the reason for all of this? Why do Bionis and Mechonis have to keep on fighting? I have to find out why!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "So, that is your fight?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Dunban!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I will never forgive what he's done. And yet... Your words. They ring true. I feel their weight. We have to help Fiora now. We'll worry about the rest later."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Right!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Did you hear that, Mumkhar?

You went too far, you fool."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "At least he's out of the way.

What's up?!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Did you see something?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "No..."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You did see something."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "All right. It was the silver Mechon... Fiora. She's definitely inside the fortress."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "All right. At least we know what to expect."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "So Fiora is inside. I can't let that vision come true. I have to save her!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Here's our way in."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "There's no turning back."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We can't let them find us. Let's move!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Right!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora's in here somewhere."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Let's get looking. Keep your eyes peeled. I'm ready for anything. I'll trash any Mechon that tries to mess with us! Where are we?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Looks like the control room for an ether blast furnace. There, look at that."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "So this is what supplies the Mechon with ether energy."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Shulk! What's that?! Looks like fun! Riki want to ride!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "We didn't come here to mess about, furball! Time to bounce on!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Hold on! If we can stop that piston, we might be able to shut down the blast furnace."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Nice idea. Cut off the Mechon's ether supply."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Riki say we try!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yeah, but how are we supposed to stop something that massive?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "If we can stop the turbines driving the piston, it should work. And the turbines should be nearby."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Right. Let's search for them."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Nice one! We did it!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "This should prevent them from mobilising any large Mechon squads for now. Hopefully we've improved the allied force's chances."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Hold steady, my brother."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Friends! Here here!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It looks like the door's been unlocked."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Nice. Let's get down to the blast furnace."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "If we're lucky, Fiora might be down there."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, is that?"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Spear ones! Loads and loads of spear Mechon!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Stop! Don't you recognise Shulk?! Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora. Please. Don't you remember us at all?!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "It's no use. Everyone, it's time to retreat."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Got it!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Understood."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Move! Shulk! You all right?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yeah, I think so. What do we do now, Shulk? We ain't gonna last long here!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora! Try and remember! It's us! What is...?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Oi, what's going on?! What's happened to the Monado?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Look out!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I'm OK."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk! Wait here!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Fiora! Stop this right now. How could you? Shulk came here to save you! Do you hear me? Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "You must run."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora! Fiora... Or whoever you are."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Please, run! The machine is not under my control."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Not under your control? Is it him?!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Egil..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora! What have you done to her?! Why make Homs into Mechon?! Why are you making them attack Bionis? Never! Who would ever submit to you?!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Forget about him. We have to get out of here."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "But... But what about Fiora?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "If we die here today, she will be... She will be lost forever."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You chunk of scrap! So it was you who did that to the Monado!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "But how can you... Never! If the Monado really is powerless, then why would you want it for yourself? I'll never give it to you! Never!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Egil! I cannot allow this. That boy is at risk. Shulk! Don't let him die! Help Shulk! Help them! Who are you?! Whoever you are... Please lend me your strength! I won't let you do this!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora?! Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Egil... No matter how much you yearn for revenge, I will not permit you to have your way!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "No, stop!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Please... Survive!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Not good! Let's get out of here!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk! Where are you?! Shulk, get back here!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora...

I never forgot you, or the others."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Then, why?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Because I wasn't me anymore.

Inside my heart, I was crying out desperately. But you didn't hear me. Nobody did."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We always believed it was you."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "It's OK. You don't have to say that.

I understood that much."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What do you think happened to her?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Maybe she's sleeping. Or maybe she's trapped like I was."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I hope she stays trapped.

I don't think she's totally to blame."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Why not?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "She needed my body for something.

You must be hungry."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "No thanks. But I'd like some water."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "OK. You should eat. Even if you're not hungry. You need to get your strength back."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "No, I'm fine. This body has its uses. I never need to eat. I never get hungry. I just run on water. Don't worry. I prefer my old body, but this one has some advantages. Shulk. You can leave me. It's OK."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What?!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I mean, look at me, Shulk. This body is a Mechon body.

Am I missing something?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "In the old days, Shulk was kinda frail. You know, like a little Bunniv that gets bossed around by the other colony animals.

Do you remember Colony 6?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "The Mechon were always on the doorstep of our home, the colony.

And you know why?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Because you were strong?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "We had no choice but to be strong.

There'll be plenty of time to stare at my feet when I'm old and crooked. Get it?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "I get it. So now what?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "We go looking for Shulk and Fiora!

I don't think he'd ever cry in front of you two."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "So he does cry?!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "When no one's watching?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Yep. He's always been like that. He's a big softy, but he hates anyone seeing it."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I never knew."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Nope! I don't believe it!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Take it easy."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I'm OK. I want to see my brother. Let's go, Shulk."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "If you can't walk, I'll carry you."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I'm much heavier now."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I've been pumping my guns."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I can see! Reyn, you really looked after Shulk for me."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I wanted to, but it feels more like he's the one who's been protecting me."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That's not true!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "It's OK. I know it, you know it. I'm not here to protect you anymore."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "But you are here for something."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. What I did just now. It don't matter how strong you get, you ain't got eyes in the back of your head. So I've got your back!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn, you..."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Reyn, you're like a whole new person."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What do you mean by that?!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I mean, it's good you've become so dependable."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Was I that un-dependable before?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Take it as a compliment!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You haven't changed a bit. What would we do without you?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Right, let's go. You wanna see my brother cry, don't you?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yeah, wouldn't miss it!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What is it?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I can hear something."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "What? I can't hear anything."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Maybe our sense of hearing isn't strong enough."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Low sounds. More than one. Watch out! Something's here!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Friends stop for Riki! Riki very hungry! And Riki sleepy! If Riki not rest now, Riki not keep going!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "We can't have that, can we? We'll rest here before going any further. Melia, do you need to rest?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I am fine."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Good! Break time!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "What's this?"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Heropon Riki have big fight with fish. Riki win.

Dundun eat too."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I thought you said you couldn't move if you didn't rest."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Riki very tired. But Riki very hungry too."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "How considerate of you."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Riki not understand Dundun!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Don't try to hide it. You realised Melia was lagging behind. She would never admit how tired she was. That's the real reason you asked. Now that's good fish. Even in this strange place, at least the fish tastes like it should."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Riki glad Dundun like yum yum fish!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Yeah, thank you."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Melly is tired, but Riki tired too. And Dundun not look happy."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "What's this? Am I that transparent?"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Riki want to hear Dundun's story. Riki listen carefully. For Riki is the Heropon."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I'm not sure what that's got to do with it. Well, seeing as you're here. I'll tell you."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Yay! Riki listen."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I have a sister. Her name is Fiora."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Riki know. She wears silver armour. Shulk look everywhere for her."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Indeed. Shulk and Fiora... Everyone knows they like each other, but they're just not ready I suppose. They are the perfect match, but if they don't hurry up and tell each other..."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Even Riki know that!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I suppose everyone does. But now Fiora has become something else."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "She forget Shulk. She forget Dundun too."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "She did. But, Shulk won't give up that easily. Knowing that he's out there looking for her fills me with hope.

Dundun watch over Fiora. That is all a daddypon can do. Riki make mistake. Dundun not daddypon."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Well, I am her older brother."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "But just like daddypon, watching over family. Same watch over. Dundun do what he must."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Who would have thought it? I never imagined I would be getting such advice from you."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Riki have big family of littlepon. Riki raised and say goodbye to many littlepon. Riki know some things."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You can say that again. I had you all wrong."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "It doesn't look like the others are here."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Unfortunate. I hope everyone is safe."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Everyone safe. Everyone strong!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Riki is right. It is simply a matter of when we will happen across them."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Everyone landed in the same area. They have to be around here somewhere."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Friends look here! Riki find it yesterday when Riki go scouting."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I wonder where this pipe leads."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Go go! Riki has feeling Shulk and friends are on other side!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Feeling? Well, I'm willing to give your Nopon instinct a try."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "As am I. The pipe it is."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "A village in a place like this!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Melia!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Guys!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You're all right!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. And... We found Fiora."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Dunban."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Fiora! Do you remember me?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Sorry if I made you worry."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "It's all right. I'm just so glad you're alive."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Dear brother."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, is that your childhood friend?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Congratulations. I'm glad she is safe."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Thank you. I couldn't have done it without you."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "But how did you all get here? And what is this place anyway?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "These people helped us. This is their home. Machina... You mean, machine people?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "So, are you Mechon?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "A form of mechanical life born of the Mechonis... Is that correct?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Life born of the Mechonis... So there is life here, just like on Bionis?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Explain to us why you invaded our world. What did we ever do to you?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Dunban, please hear her out."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "But..."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "These Machina... They're good people."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora? Ever since she was given this body, she hasn't been feeling too good. But we honestly don't know what to do."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I'm OK, really."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "For us?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, I'm..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on her."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Thanks."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Hah! He's massive..."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "We were told that you were waiting for us."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Request?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It is."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Yes. Although unfortunately we were unable to stop Egil. Do you know him? He claims to be the leader of Mechonis. Your son? You want us to kill your son? That is no small request."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Who was Lady Meyneth?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You talk like you saw all this. Ain't this all just an ancient myth? You can't be serious?!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "The people of Mechonis must have a longer lifespan. Just like we High Entia live far longer than Homs."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I get that, but he can't have lived that long."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "But why do you want your son dead? From what you've told us, I would've thought you'd want us to destroy the Bionis rather than kill your own son."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "So he wants to do to us what the Bionis did to the Machina?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Didn't you ever try to stop him?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Where is Egil now? I feel sorry for him."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What're you talkin' about?! Did you forget what he did to us?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I haven't forgotten, or forgiven! But Egil's clearly suffered a lot in his life. You don't feel any sympathy at all?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "All I know is, this stinks. Who cares what he's been through?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Reyn!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I understand about Egil. But why us? You should be aware that Shulk's sword, the Monado, has the power to destroy Mechonis weaponry. It's said that it was once the sword of the Bionis. Doesn't the very sight of it make you quiver?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "What do you mean? Is she sick? That's right. How? But you can treat her, can't you? Please!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "That's OK. I don't want to be a burden to Shulk. I don't care if I have a machine body. Just make it so I can fight beside him."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Fiora..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "A problem? But where? We'll take a look. The beach at the base of Digit 5, right? I think we found it. Is this the Piezoelectric Unit? Linada, will Fiora be OK now? But! You're right. I'll try and get some rest. Thank you for everything you're doing. Yes? I'll go and see him. He wants Egil stopped, and so do we. But I need to sleep on it. Thank you. Umm... Yes, very well. I wanted to...talk about your son. Yes. We agree with you. Egil must be stopped. But we can't act now. Before we came here, we heard of plans to form an allied force on Bionis. Any day now they're going to launch an attack on Mechonis. But it's too dangerous. Egil has made a weapon that could kill us all."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "The weapon that Mumkhar was using? The one that shoots green fluid?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "He said it can decompose any being from Bionis."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We have to go back and warn them. Before it's too late. Dickson?! What are you doing here? I can't believe you found us."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You know each other? Why did you keep that to yourself? That information is vital to all who fight Mechonis."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "So they escaped to live in peace? Somewhere they wouldn't be seen. Makes sense."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "So this is where you obtained all that stuff you brought back to Colony 9. I wondered where you were getting it from."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I haven't discovered why, but it disintegrates anything it touches. But only if it's living tissue from Bionis."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Dickson!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "OK! Let me think about it for a bit. Fiora. Dickson, listen. Yes. What are you fighting for, Dickson? Because he's trying to exterminate the Homs? Really? Will they launch an attack on Mechonis? Prince Kallian said that? Yeah. I think that's the type of man he is. We're going to the Mechonis capital. I don't know. I can't forgive the Mechon for what they've done. But after listening to Miqol, I think there might be another way. Do you really think that?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "We won't let Shulk die. Not ever!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora! Are you OK to be walking around?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Yep!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "I have to hand it to her. That Linada's pretty good. And not just with machines. She's also quite familiar with organic physiology."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "You went to get the thing she needed to cure me, right? I'm sorry I've caused all this hassle. But I'm fine now. I'll be by your side, fighting to protect you. No matter where we go, no matter how difficult it gets, Shulk will do the right thing. It doesn't matter how slim our chances, Shulk will always stick to the right path."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "And don't forget, it's because of Shulk that we're all here, fighting together. I think that shows he has a strong character. Am I wrong, Dickson?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Dickson, we're going to the Mechonis capital. About the allied force... Yes. Thank you for all your help."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Vanea..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Is she a Machina as well?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Hold on. You mean she's Egil's sister?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "And you say she'll help us? I dunno why she'd help us, but... We'll try and find her when we get there."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I will. Thank you. Is that possible?! Thank you, Linada!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora..."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Don't make that face! OK, let's go!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What is it? We're in your debt. Linada. We will."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Linada, thank you for everything."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Bionis and Mechonis."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "It's so different seeing them from this kind of perspective."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "We cannot see it from here, but our people are still fighting up there."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's difficult to believe that two such huge things ever fought each other.

Out of fear we commit terrible atrocities and call them acts of self-preservation."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fear gives rise to more fear. A never-ending circle of hatred."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Perhaps that circle can be broken?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fear. It must be what's driving this. What's made Egil act this way."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "We're inside the Mechonis."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Just how I imagined it. It's all totally mechanical. It ain't gonna be easy getting up this thing."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Egil is at the top..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What's up, Shulk?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Look. It's a switch to activate a lift. If we can get it to work, it should take us up."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Riki want to ride lift!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We can't.

If we can connect the power to the switch, we should be able to use the lift."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Whoa, don't look down! Anyone know where we are? Other than high up?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Maybe...somewhere around the thigh?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "The thigh? You mean we ain't even half way there yet?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Stop moaning about it. Look. We can make camp over there. Let's rest for a while."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Fiora, are you sure you're feeling OK?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I feel a bit like I haven't got used to this body yet. But please, whatever you do, don't tell Shulk about it. I'm sorry, Dunban."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Don't worry about it.

But I want to keep using this one for now."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, get a clue, man! It's more than just a weapon to her.

Hey, Reyn."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What is it?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Do you want to beat the Mechon?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Of course.

My Gadolt..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Sharla?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Explain it to me. I mean, why does Egil want to make us into Mechon?

Deliver us into Egil's hands?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "So this is the Mechonis capital."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "It looks so desolate. Like there are no signs of anyone living here."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "It truly is a soulless city."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Here bad place. Riki want to go."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "So the Machina built this whole city? Not too shabby."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It looks like the buildings have been here for a very long time."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Look, Shulk! Dinobeast! Dinobeast eat city!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "A Dinobeast? Here?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "But how?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "It is a Telethia!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "It looks like it's stone."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Why would there be a Telethia in a place like this?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Why did the Telethia attack your city? Wasn't the ancient battle only between the Bionis and the Mechonis themselves?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It looks like the power's up and running."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Fiora, what's the matter?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Everyone follow me."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What is that?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It looks like it's here.

Whoa, you're right!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "These are memories of a time long forgotten."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Hey."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "They were left behind by the Machina, before they abandoned this place so that others may know their story."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Her voice sounds like..."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "In ancient times, when the Bionis and the Mechonis came into existence, I was born as well. Just as the Bionis had a soul, I came to exist in this world as the soul of the Mechonis. I created my children on Mechonis and acquired this body. They called themselves Machina. And Mechonis was transformed into a world brimming with life. The Machina gave rise to an advanced civilization and built this great city."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "This city?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Can't believe it used to be so lively."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "They lived their lives in peace and harmony. The gentle Machina worshipped me. Life also flourished on Bionis. The Machina generously shared the fruits of their civilization with the peoples of the Bionis. They believed their two worlds would grow, hand in hand. Then a terrible fate descended on them from above."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Is that the Monado?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "But why?

And so I confronted Zanza."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Zanza?!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "The battle waged on and on.

What happened to the Machina was a tragedy, but we cannot forgive the Mechon attack on Bionis."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "What worries me is the Monado that the Bionis used.

If you hadn't been using the Monado, we wouldn't have lasted five minutes."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "But it was Zanza who bestowed this sword upon me.

That was your last chance!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "He's not giving up.

Until then...stay safe."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Drink it. You must be thirsty. Don't go dying on us. After we take Egil down, we'll get you looked at. I know a good doctor nearby. She is Machina though. Reyn."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You are Egil, leader of Mechonis. Wait. I didn't come to fight you. I didn't come to surrender to you either. I just want to know something. I've seen the legends of the Machina right here in the capital. I think I understand why you want to fight the Bionis. But why send the Mechon to attack the people of Bionis? I don't see the joke! We share the same world! The Homs, Nopon and High Entia live in harmony, so why not the Machina too? Of course."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "A military strategy in which you cut the supply lines and starve out the enemy."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I don't understand.

Are ya sayin' we're just food?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "So you attacked Bionis to reduce the Bionis' power supply? Foolish? We only grieve for those we've lost, as you do! Machina or Homs we've suffered the same! Don't tell me it's different! So then... Yes, we can. To get this far... we've fought long and hard."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk... This whole thing stinks, but he's got a point!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Agreed. Egil, leader of Mechonis! The lives of the Machina and the lives of all that lives on Bionis are one and the same. We won't stop. Not until you realise that! You know, Egil. You know the reason. The golden Mechon! Zanza?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I won't let you kill Shulk! Yes... Meyneth, the villagers, everyone loved you. That is why they wished to live alongside you.

The whole city's gonna come down!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk! Run where?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We have to get out of the city!

Was it you who saved us when we fell from the fortress? Meyneth? Where's Fiora?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "It's OK. I'm here too.

No, you're...?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "The Mechonis and I exist as one. Egil is using ether energy absorbed from the Bionis to force it to move.

You have our gratitude. We must go there at once."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Then let's get a move on. This one's for Gadolt."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Hear, hear."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Too right! Gadolt's wishes live on through me. We will fight to the end."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Understood."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Oi! Look at that! What the?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I know."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Vanea? Actually, I'm grateful. Thanks to this body, I got to see Shulk and the others again. Shall I call her? She is usually asleep. Maybe she just doesn't want to disturb me. It's an unusual feeling... Two hearts in one body. It's not every day you get to experience something like this. It's as if I can see into her heart. We each know what the other's thinking. But it's strange. It feels like there's a part of my heart that's hidden. It's the part that holds Meyneth's feelings, and I can't see them. Maybe it's only natural. Everyone has one or two secrets, right? But I know how much she cares about this world. That's why I'm happy to let her use my body. Yeah, I know."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Glad to hear it."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "That's great news."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "We won't let 'em down.

Stop playing around. Ohh... But... How did you do that?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I can't work it out. Ever since we came to Mechonis, my abilities have been changing. Why would that happen? If it's true that Zanza used the Monado to lay waste to Mechonis, then is it right for me to use it? Is what I'm trying to do really the right thing?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Shulk... Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "What's wrong?!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "No! No! It's happening to him too. Shulk! Hold on! You all right?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. It's OK. I'm fine now."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Man..."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Your control of the Monado has always been flawless. It never crossed my mind that this would happen to you too.

How many times do I have to tell ya? If something's up, you've got to spit it out, man! I ain't just talking about visions. I mean whatever's on your mind. All right?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Sorry, Reyn."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Don't go apologising. It's my fault for not noticing. Let's get one thing straight. I've still got your back."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Thanks. No. This wasn't caused by the Apocrypha. It's a completely different kind of power."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What's happening to me?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I know I should be glad we made it this far, but if we don't find the Apocrypha Generator soon..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Exactly. The fight against Egil's not going to be easy with the Monado in its current state. And we don't know what kind of toll it'll take on Shulk's body.

Egil's gonna be scrap metal when I'm through with him!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It's just as I thought. The Monado feels the same as it did before the Apocrypha took effect. No, it feels even more powerful. The Bionis' Monado. And this Monado. They have to be connected somehow. Why am I remembering that dream? Why now? Without the power, I can't stop Egil. I have to concentrate. All I have to think about is how to stop the Mechonis. If the Monado does bring about the end, then I know what to do. Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, what were you thinking about?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Nothing."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "So.

What?!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Nyapakapow!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Chew on that, Apocawhatever! We did it, Shulk! Shulk? Oi! Whoa!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "What's happened to the Monado?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "It must've changed just as the generator was destroyed.

Next up - Egil!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Can you go on?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Me? I'm all right. Come on. We have to stop Egil. Egil! Stop the Mechonis! There has to be a way for us to live in peace! There's no reason for us to fight! You must stop this now!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What's that?! Egil!

Don't do it!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That voice. Who is that? I will. I'll kill him. A thousand times. Yes. I want to. I'll kill him. For Fiora. For the Emperor.

No!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I've forgotten all about that. I realised that we both share the same pain. Egil, I don't have any reason to kill you. I know. But I won't do it. I can't kill you, but I can stop your blade. And I'll do it. Over and over again, until... we understand each other. OK? I don't understand. Does being controlled by the Monado mean you will eventually become Zanza? What do you mean? I don't know much about any curse. For now, all I can do is this, Egil.

His flesh was sealed away on Prison Island. His soul, and hence the Monado, was confined to Ose Tower."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "In those ruins?! But what does this have to do with Shulk? What are you saying?! You planned all this when you found Shulk? What?!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Shulk was already dead?! That's impossible! We grew up together!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "But why use Shulk? What was it that made you choose Shulk as your vessel?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "So then... Shulk's ability to use the Monado..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "And those visions that he used to save us!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "You evil...!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "What are you gonna do, Dickson?!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "The Bionis!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Bionis moves!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "It's... the Monado!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Why?! Egil and Shulk had put their differences aside!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Zanza! Reyn, now!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yeah!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "How could you do this?!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I finally understand. The futures of our children belong to them alone. Though we are their creators, their lives are theirs to control. Even if the passage of fate is as you have decided, I will teach you the strength of their will to resist. Zanza. If you choose to deny the existence of every living being but yourself, then I choose to fight. To fight for them! That's right. We won't let you erase everyone's futures! They are living beings! If you cannot understand this, you have no right to call yourself a god!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Zanza! Meyneth!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Zanza disappear."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "He's gone.

What's happening now?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I understand your feelings. Leave it to us. We know what we must do. We will do all we can for the people of Mechonis."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Egil... Go in peace."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Let's go! We're leaving the Mechonis! Reyn! Take care of Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Got it."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "You OK?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Yes."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Good. It still works. The whole place is going to blow! We must return to Junks via the Central Factory!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Let's go!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Dundun, what about Egil?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "He will fight Zanza to the very end.

Let's move, everyone!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "The Mechonis!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Look starboard! What's that cloud?!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "It's Telethia!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Dickson! That's enough! Why, Dickson?! What made you like this?! Shulk looked up to you, respected you!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Dickson! Don't let Zanza control you! Wake up!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Before we were born?!

What was the purpose of my life? No. I've got it wrong. I was never alive. It was Zanza! All along! I... Everything I did was... That voice!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Shulk. Here. Miqol made you a wonderful new weapon. Since you lost your Monado, I mean. It uses the latest Machina technology. Use it when you wake up. Then let's all go on living."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "It's ironic. We want to escape Zanza but we can't leave his body, the Bionis."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Well...this is our home."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I cannot be sure, but I believe not.

There's no way Kallian would leave the fate of the High Entia to you if that was gonna happen!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Precisely. And Melia... If we are to survive, we must fight Zanza and the Telethia. It may not be the case with all of them, but a large number of Telethia were once High Entia - your subjects and your brethren."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I am prepared for that. Even if it means harming my brethren, it is for the protection of the survivors. That is the final wish of my father and brother. I will fight! To free the souls stolen by Zanza."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You are a fighter, Melia. We will need all your strength in the fight ahead."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "How's Shulk?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "He's going to make it. His wound has closed. I think Meyneth used the last of her power to protect him..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "So he's OK."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Linada is tending to him now."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Fiora?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "He won't wake up.

We're backed into a corner, but we'll give it all we've got. What do you mean by that, Alvis? You've got it backwards, man. Just 'cos he thinks it, doesn't make it so. We decide whether to keep living or not."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "I agree. Even though he is our creator, that does not afford him the right to take our lives on a whim."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "So you think we should just shut up and die?!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "You are mistaken if you think we will simply accept such a fate and wait to die."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "We'll never stop fighting. Not till the end! It ain't the outcome that's important. It's the will to fight back. Alvis! Whose side are you on?! You scared or something?! Frightened of a few Telethia?!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Fiora?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Sorry. I need to go and get some air."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Fiora, are you all right?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Guess I wasn't hiding it well. I didn't want to worry anyone."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "It must be difficult living with that body."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I'm getting more and more used to it. But people still look at me funny. Ah, it's not that bad. It feels pretty comfortable actually. I don't need to worry about food or anything like that."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I see."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "This body... The energy from the chest component made it work. It turned out to be a Monado. Such a strange feeling."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "A Monado? Was that the Monado that Zanza took from Meyneth?! Will your body cease to function?!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I'll be fine for now. There's still some stored energy left."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "But then what?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Melia, if I ever... Please take care of Shulk."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Don't talk like that! How can you ask me such a thing?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I'm sorry."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "There's no need to apologise."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "You're right. Thank you, Melia."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "If Shulk awakes, will you tell him?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "No. He worries too much anyway."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "He does worry. It's just like him."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Actually, I'm already dead. I have been since the Mechon attacked."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Fiora..."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "But I'm happy now. This body has given me the chance to live. Maybe I don't have much time left. But at least I can be with Shulk for a little while longer."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Do you feel that strongly for him?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Yes. That's why I'll fight on, and help him in any way I can. Let's get back. Everyone will start worrying."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Yes. You are right."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "And Melia... Can you keep it secret from the others?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "You do not want them to worry. I admire your strength."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Maybe I'll tell him. But only when the time is right."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I won't say a word. I'm nothing compared to her."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "A siren?!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Fiora! Let's hurry back!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "OK!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "That siren! Is that...?!

Believe in your own true strength, Shulk!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Everyone..."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Shulk. It's time, Shulk. Let's finish this."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I will not fail. With your faith in me, and our strength combined... We can do this. Face me. Stand and fight! Dickson!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Get back here! You expect us to let you go?! What?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Enough. It's Zanza we're after. Not him."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "OK..."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, his wounds..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Where are we?!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "What happen?! It night-time! Is Riki have bad dream?!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Look down! Look at all the stars!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We're not on Bionis any more. There's no land or sea either."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "It's beautiful."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Is that a ball of water? It's you!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "What is it, Shulk?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That voice! It's Zanza!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "But he looks different."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Meyneth's Monado."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "You gonna give him a reward?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Are you so arrogant to believe that the High Entia, no, all life on Bionis, are nothing but your playthings?! Yes. You don't know how it feels to have slain my brethren after they had transformed into Telethia!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "So this is the arrogance of a creator. But though you feign omnipotence, the High Entia still confined you to Prison Island! That is how limited you are."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Until I was born."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Meyneth..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Never! I don't wanna be your vessel or your disciple! I just want to live my life as a Homs. In a world without you! Is that why you laid waste to Mechonis?!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "So you're saying us Homs are next in line, eh?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "You're wrong! Meyneth chose to exist alongside us! She grew to consider us her friends. You should have accepted that! But what you were hoping for was not friendship. You wanted worthless slaves. Our lives as food! We will not allow it! We cannot! We will stop you! I don't know. It comes from the bottom of my heart. It shows me my enemy. It reveals the future I must change!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "The future we see is not set in stone. There are infinite possibilities based on the paths we choose. You should be well aware of this notion. For that is how you have always existed!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Why should we care?! What's important isn't whether you can see the future or not. It's the will to make a choice, and the strength to seize your destiny! Our time has come. Our destiny is our own!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "It is not only you that has the right. Every living thing has the freedom to choose the path they walk. And that is the future!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That voice! That is something I decided long ago! Today, we use our power to fell a god, and then seize our destiny! Where am I? Your home? Whose voice was that? And that voice. It's Meyneth! And that was how we were born. Bionis being filled with life, and the Telethia coming to wipe it out. It was all the will of Zanza. His future and our future. It might have been possible for them to coexist. New god?! Alvis, what are you? Alvis? I don't know. All I wanted to do was stop Zanza having his way. That's all. I cannot be a god!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Too right! You're great 'n' all, but there's no way you're a god."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Everyone!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Look, don't worry, Shulk. None of us want to be gods anyway. And I don't really know what the future holds. But we just want to live our life as it comes."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Eating grub, sleeping, laughing, crying. Sometimes arguing. Sounds all right!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Yes. He's right. And being with the ones we love. That's enough."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Even so, we change little by little. Every day is a little different from the last. We do not know what the future will hold."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "More fun not knowing! Riki want to have fun!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Life's little surprises are what makes it great. We don't know what's going to happen. It's worrying sometimes, but it's also exciting. Don't you think?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. Isn't that called progress? Aren't we all continuously evolving? I'm not sure we need a more dramatic change than that."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. You're right. Little by little. Each day as it comes. That's how we should live. That's our world. Alvis... It sounds like you don't think I can make my own decisions. I'm supposed to be the god! I won't decide. The future should be decided by each and every person in the world. And so, what I... No, what we wish for is... A world with no gods!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Ah, yes. That's excellent. So, you can take the materials to District Four? Thanks to Melia and Vanea. The High Entia and Machina have some amazing technology. Hear, hear. And may it last forever."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Dunban?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Fiora! What is it?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Have you seen Shulk?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "He just left. I don't know where he's gone, but he was with Reyn and the others."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "OK. Thank you."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Fiora!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Yes?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "It's nothing. Good luck!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "If you're looking for Shulk, he is not here."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Amazing. It's like you've got eyes in the back of your head. What were you looking at? The sea?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "I wasn't looking at anything in particular. If anything, Fiora, I was thinking. Thinking about the future that awaits us all."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Wow. You're so much more thoughtful than me."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Really? I don't think so. I was just answering your question."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "But I know what you mean. You're right. We've been through a lot."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Yes. We have. I am grateful to all of you. It is because I met you that I experienced so much. And it is the reason I am here now."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Yes. We're happy you're here too. Thanks, Melia. For everything. I'm glad I met you."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "And I you."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Almost got it!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Go Reyn! Go Reyn! Riki really hungry!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Go on! Put your back into it, Reyn! Are you OK?!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "It's salty! What's up with the water being so salty?!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Reyn bad fisherman! Riki want eat big fish!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Give us a break. You try next time, furball!"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Fishing is Reyn's job! Riki's job is eating!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Hang on a sec. Isn't Oka gonna have a massive go at you if you don't go back to her with 14 fish to feed all your littlepon?"}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Riki forgot! Wifeypon very angry if not catch more fish!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "It ain't me she's gonna be angry with."}, {"prompt": "Riki would say: ", "completion": "Reyn catch fish! Catch fish now! Fish! Fish!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Here you are! The breeze feels so good."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "It does."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "What is it?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "That hairstyle. It looks good on you. That's all. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Really? I was thinking about growing it out, but... Hey, which do you prefer?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Both, of course."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Come on. What am I supposed to say to that?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Sorry. OK. It's great like that. Don't change it."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "I'd forgotten what it feels like to do this. I wonder what the future has in store for us."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Who knows. I'm sure it will be full of ups and downs."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Ups and downs?"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I don't know what the future holds. But that means I can imagine the possibilities. We can achieve anything we put our minds to."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Yeah. You're right!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Do you remember what the Monado, I mean Alvis, said to us the last time we saw him?"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Yes. Of course."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "One day I hope I can meet them all. The people of this endless world."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Me too. We will. I know it."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "We'll meet them. And whatever happens, we'll face our future together. Who's this?!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Ain't she the one who attacked us in the capital?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Tyrea! What are you doing here?! You're hurt."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Watch it! Oh!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Tyrea. What happened?"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Is she dead?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "No. It looks like she's just passed out."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Let's get her to the infirmary. Reyn!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Come on, why me?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Please."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Is she OK?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Her injuries aren't severe."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "When the Bionis awoke, the ether flow around the colony became unstable.

Luckily, the level of ether energy here is not as high as on the upper regions of Bionis. That may be what kept her safe. Or perhaps..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Perhaps what?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "No, it's nothing."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Something about this makes me feel uneasy."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "I know what you mean. We'll have to keep an eye on her recovery."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Why does she hate you so much, Melia? You're both High Entia. Is being pure-blooded really that important?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Tyrea's birth mother is most likely my step-mother."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "You don't mean...Yumea?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Yes. I heard about it from Kallian after I returned from the tomb. Mother was leader of the Inquisitors, a secretive organisation operating in the shadows of the imperial household. The group plotted to maintain the imperial bloodline through a clandestine ritual - a ritual where Tyrea was conceived."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "And she was secretly raised as an Inquisitor assassin."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Hold on a sec. Are you saying that Tyrea is Kallian's half-sister?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "That's right."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Then isn't she in the same position as you?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Mm-hmm. Tyrea! You're awake! You're wrong! I'm...!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "I don't buy that for a second!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Reyn?!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Pride of your people?! How about you're jealous of Melia! Ain't ya? You're envious of her, right? Of how she lives her life. You just want everyone to feel sorry for you for being in the shadows all your life. I'm sayin' that you'll never have a life like Melia's! You don't have the faintest idea why Melia's been fighting. Even if you'd been born in her place, the Emperor still would've chosen her as his successor. Succeeding the imperial line ain't all about blood. It's about takin' on the will to do whatever it takes for your land, for your people, when the time comes. That's what makes Melia different from you!"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "Both of you, stop this! This is no time for pointless bickering."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "He's right. We survivors shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves. Right, time's up! I want the room cleared out."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Yeah, OK..."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "And you. You need to calm down and get some rest."}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "What's going on?!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Look! Over there! The colony!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Telethia!"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Guys! She's gone!"}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Tyrea, you mean?!"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Could that Telethia be her?!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "No. At least, I'm fairly certain."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "What?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "There's no time now. We must pursue it. It must be Tyrea after all!"}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "What do we do?! Do we have to fight her?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "There's no time to think about it. Ready yourselves!"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Shulk, I must..."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "I know."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Tyrea! You're safe? *gasp*"}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "Yumea?! But why? Didn't she feel betrayed?"}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Her final wish?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "This is my responsibility. Father entrusted me with the empire and its people. What I believe in is the will of those struggling to survive. I have to fight if I am to convey this to the next generation. Besides, Yumea is your birth mother. There is no need for you to carry out such an unpleasant task. This is a duty that my father and brother conferred upon me. Tyrea... I believe you and I are alike. Tyrea..."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "Well, there she goes."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Is she going to be OK on her own?"}, {"prompt": "Dunban would say: ", "completion": "She'll be all right.

When you said you and Tyrea are alike."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Tyrea must be half Homs, just like me."}, {"prompt": "Reyn would say: ", "completion": "What?! But the wings on her head..."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Not all half-blooded High Entia have small wings, only the majority. Some are indistinguishable from pure-blooded High Entia."}, {"prompt": "Sharla would say: ", "completion": "Dominant and recessive inheritance. I've studied this."}, {"prompt": "Shulk would say: ", "completion": "So that's why..."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "Melia, do you think Yumea knew this would happen?"}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Perhaps. Actually, she had to have known. At least, that's what I believe."}, {"prompt": "Fiora would say: ", "completion": "She was her mother, after all. She must have been aware."}, {"prompt": "Melia would say: ", "completion": "Yes."}]
